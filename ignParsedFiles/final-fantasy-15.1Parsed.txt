Big Story
Final Fantasy XV is a fantasy RPG originally announced at E3 2013. Set in somewhat modern times but with fantasy and sci-fi influences, the story focuses on Noctis Lucis Caelum, a prince on an epic journey from his home in the kingdom of Lucis. Noctis is joined on his journey by three companions, his chamberlain Ignis Scienta, his royal guard Gladiolus Amicitia, and his school friend Prompto Argentum. 
Noctis is heir to the kingdom of his father Regis, but his peaceful life is shattered when the belligerent empire of Neflheim invades the realm of Lucis. Against this backdrop of a world at war, Noctis Lucis Caelum and his closest friends embark on an epic journey to restore peace to the world.
