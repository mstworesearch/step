Cheats and Secrets - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page collects cheats, secrets, exploits, and other tricks for Horizon: Zero Dawn that allow you to get easy XP, infinite ammo, and invincibility. Know something we don't? 
The short version: reloading a save will restore your health bar and any ammo for a heavy weapon if you're carrying one when you save. 
 


Heavy Weapons are items that can be collected from powerful enemies, such as the Ravager's cannon, Thunderjaw's disc launcher or a Deathbringer heavy machine gun. 
Once you collect the weapon, simply make your way back to a campfire and perform a save while you still have some ammo left. Reload the save to refill your ammo. 
Ravagers, Thunderjaws and other large beasts will all succumb rather easily to these heavy weapons, which makes this exploit great for grinding for XP and leveling up quickly. 
There is a hidden armor called "Shield-Weaver", which renders Aloy (almost) invincible. The armor contains a rechargeable shield that absorbs all incoming damage, including falling damage. If the shield is close to failing, it will blink red and emit a high-pitched alarm sound. 
 


The Shield-Weaver can be found by completing the quest Ancient Armory and finding all five hidden Power Cells throughout the game. 
The tearblaster is a somewhat hidden weapon. Unlike other weapons it cannot be bought from merchants. It's a quest reward for side quest "Hunter's Blind". This gives you a treasure box with this weapon inside. It shoots compressed air to take off a machine's armor and components. This can be very useful against certain types of enemies, especially the ones that carry weapons on their backs.
