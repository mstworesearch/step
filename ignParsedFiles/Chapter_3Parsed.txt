Chapter 3 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
After a long narration and cutscene, the story will take you to Italy and place you in control of Heihachi. After some plot exposition, you'll have to fight Claudio in the Church stage. At the start of the fight, you'll need to immediately crouch and avoid Claudio's bow attack. You have very little time to avoid this as soon as the cutscene is over and the fight begins. 
Once you do so, fight Claudio like normal and defeat him. Watch out for his charge armor attack that allows him to absorb hits. When he does this, and he will frequently, he'll go right through any of your attacks and deal massive damage. Just the same, duck under Claudio's bow attack when he charges it up. 
When you take down Claudio the first time, he'll get back up and become enraged. Both of your health meters refill, but you won't recieve a Rage Mode boost at all. Fight Claudio in the same way with extra caution this time, he'll do more damage with attacks by being in this enraged state. 
Once you defeat Claudio, a cutscene will trigger and play out till the end of the chapter.
