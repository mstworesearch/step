Ranking the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies' Box Office Openings - IGN

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales debuted to an estimated $62.2 million domestically over the Memorial Day weekend, along with the 12th largest international box office opening ever with about $208 million. But how does the fifth Pirates film's debut stack up to Jack Sparrow's previous voyages?
Take a look below to see how all five Pirates of the Caribbean films' box office hauls compare in regard to opening weekends both adjusted and unadjusted for inflation, as well as total worldwide gross. Numbers via Box Office Mojo.
Should the estimates hold for Dead Men Tell No Tales' opening weekend it will still have the second-lowest opening of the entire Pirates franchise, both adjusted and unadjusted for inflation. Dead Men Tell No Tales may actually have the lowest opening if final box office numbers are adjusted below $62 million, which is the adjusted opening weekend tally for the original Pirates of the Caribbean, released back in 2003. (The first film is also the only Pirates movies to be released in less than 4,000 theaters.)
Dead Man's Chest reign as having the biggest opening weekend, unadjusted and adjusted, will continue to hold regardless of the actual box office returns, while it is also likely to stay on top in terms of total worldwide gross, having made $1.07 billion in its theatrical run.
Dead Men Tell No Tales' global cume, so far, is about half of what The Curse of the Black Pearl made in the franchise's maiden voyage. The fifth Pirates film has pulled in approximately $77 million so far, and is set to face continued blockbuster releases as the summer movie season continues to roll out.
Wonder Woman, The Mummy, and Cars 3 open in the next three consecutive weeks, with Transformers: The Last Knight also opening before the end of June to offer continued competition for Pirates throughout the month.
