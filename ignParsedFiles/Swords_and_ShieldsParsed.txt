Swords and Shields - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Link uses may different swords throughout his quest, and they are his primary weapon. 
The wooden sword is the first sword Link gets, and he receives it before Dungeon 1: Spirit's Grave. 
The Noble Sword is the next, and you can get it through Trading Items or Linking. It is 50% stronger than the Wooden Sword 
The Biggoron's Sword is next, and you can only get it through linking. It is 150% stronger than the noble sword, however, it takes up both spots for items, so you can't hold a shield. 
The Master Sword is last, and you must link in order to get it. It is as powerful as Biggoron's sword, but it only uses one hand. Combined with the Red Ring, it becomes super-powerful. 
The shields are not necessary in this adventure, and you can buy various ones from different shops and business shrubs throughout the game.
