Channel Surfing #273: Deadpool Gets Animated, Black Lightning, The Gifted and More - IGN

Channel Surfing lives! 
Yep, it's been a couple of months, but we actually have a new episode. This one is mostly focused on recent news from the network Upfronts, as CW ordered Black Lightning, FOX ordered The Gifted and NBC cancelled, then un-cancelled, Timeless. Plus, we chat about the cancellations of 2 Broke Girls and Last Man Standing, ABC moving Agents of SHIELD and Once Upon a Time to Fridays and more - including our reaction to the Star Trek: Discovery trailer and the announcement that Donald Glover is making a Deadpool animated series for FXX.
