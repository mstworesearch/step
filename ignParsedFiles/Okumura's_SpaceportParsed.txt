Okumura's Spaceport - Persona 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The following is IGN's walkthrough to the fifth Palace in Persona 5, Okumura's Spaceport. 
You are free to start exploring this Palace starting 9/19 and your deadline is October 11. 
The following Personas are available in this Palace: Scathach (Priestess), Arahabaki (Hermit), Lilim (Devil), Belphegor (Tower), Kaiwan (Star), Black Ooze (Moon), Mothman (Moon), Girimehkala (Moon), Mithras (Sun) 
 


You can clear this Palace in a single day. Because of this, infiltrate the Palace for the first time no later than October 8th so that you can send the calling card on the 9th and steal his heart on the 10th. 
When you're ready, gather your team and make your way into the Palace. Haru is unable to fight alongside you for now since the full power of her Persona has yet to be unlocked. She will, however, be able to utilise the biometric scanner for you. 
This is where you start inside the Palace. Head over to the lift and head down when you're ready to start. 
Take the same route as you did before to get to the biometric scanner. This time, though, there will be Shadows along the way, so prepare to fight or sneak at your own accord.
