The Best 1080p 144Hz Gaming Monitor for 2017  - IGN

Monitors with 144Hz refresh rates aren't new, but they're more popular than ever because, quite frankly, they are pretty awesome. Plus we're just now getting midrange GPUs capable of 100+ FPS on high settings. Back in the ancient days of 2015 that just wasn't possible unless you dropped some major coin, so as performance has increased monitor manufacturers have responded with corresponding features such as ultra-high refresh rates. So if you're in the market for a new display, be sure to check out our list of the best 1080p 144Hz Gaming Monitors.
Instead of updating a screen a measly 60 times a second like most monitors (60Hz), a 144Hz monitor refreshes the screen 144 times every second, which makes action appear smoother and helps eliminate motion blur. If you have enough ponies under the hood, or the stomach to, sniff, lower your game's settings if you're not on a newer GPU, a 144Hz monitor will permanently change your perception of what smooth gameplay looks and feels like, and you'll never be able to go back to 60Hz.
We recently tested five monitors to find the best 1080p 144Hz gaming monitor, and based on our testing there is a clear winner:
