How to Get the Green Tunic - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are six traditional green tunics in the game. The ones from Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, Wind Waker, and the classic NES Zelda. These can be gained by using their respective Amiibos. 
Simply scan an Amiibo (you have to enable the Amiibo rune in options and then select the rune in-game and aim your marker) and you may get one of these tunics in a random drop. If you don't succeed, try again.
