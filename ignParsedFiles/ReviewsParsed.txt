Big Story
This page contains information on IGN's reviews, including IGN's policies regarding Copies and Costs, Reviewers, and Scores 
Most reviews are conducted using publisher-, studio-, or developer-provided review copies and screenings. This is by necessity in order to provide timely reviews ahead of release. If the publisher or studio does not provide early access, a copy or ticket will be purchased at IGN's cost; the cost does not come out of the reviewer's pocket. If absolutely necessary, we will attend game review events in order to provide timely reviews. Whenever possible, they are avoided. If the supervising editor determines IGN needs to attend the event, that attendance will be disclosed. 
In the case of review events, we do not accept travel or accommodation. If we have to attend a review event, IGN pays for the appropriate critic to cover said event. 
IGN staff may accept complimentary accounts and in-game funds that are necessary for testing game features. We would, for example, allow developers to waive or offer comp subscription fees for MMOs, PSN, or XBLA and to provide our staff with in-game currency to purchase content relevant to our coverage. On behalf of its entertainment and tech reviewers, IGN similarly accepts complimentary movie tickets, comics, Blu-rays, and hardware that are necessary for the completion of timely and comprehensive reviews.
