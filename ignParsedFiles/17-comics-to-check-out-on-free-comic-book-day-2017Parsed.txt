17 Comics to Check Out on Free Comic Book Day 2017 - IGN

The first weekend of May means two things - there's a new Marvel movie in theaters (in this case, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2) and another Free Comic Book Day has arrived. If you enjoy reading comic books and not having to pay for things, it's pretty much a perfect storm of awesome.
As usual, publishers are going all-out to celebrate this year's FCBD. We've broken down the 17 books you should be on the lookout for this year, from Marvel's Secret Empire tie-in to a new Avatar adventure from Dark Horse. Check them out below:
As usual, the only way to snag these free books will be to head down to your local comic shop on Saturday, May 6. Bear in mind that while these comics are free for consumers, store owners still have to pay to order them, so consider throwing your LCS a bone and make a few actual purchases while you're there. Most shops will be running special sales and other promotions to take advantage of the festivities.
If you don't know where your nearest comic shop is, Comic Shop Locator has the answer.
Let us know what FCBD releases you'll be picking up in the comments below.
