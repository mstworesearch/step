"The Lord of No Mercy," one of Season 3's best episodes yet, will rightfully be remembered as the chapter where Emmit accidentally killed Ray during one last attempt to bury the hatchet and end their cruel squabbling. It was a harrowing, and wonderfully Fargo-y, accident that now changes the entire course the season. Ray's gone, an injured Nikki is hiding from both cops and crooks, and Gloria's main suspect has transformed into an entirely new murder case.
