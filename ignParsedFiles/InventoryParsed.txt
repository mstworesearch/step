Inventory - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There is a wide arsenal of inventory when playing Breath of the Wild, and more so than any previous game in Zelda history in fact. Between the wide selection of bows, shields, spears and swords, you're bound to find something that fits your style of play. 
Just be careful not to overuse even the fanciest of weaponry, as this time you'll literally break even the mightiest of blades if given the chance - and with very little in terms of exceptions, as only one particular sword is too important to fail thereby having a different effect if overused. Additionally, only a minuscule subset of inventory can be restored upon breakage (and these are the hardest to come by, requiring enough dedication to actually progress the plot as they are tied to Link's past and the champions who came before). 
There's also a bigger selection of armor pieces than anything Link has ever seen before, many with super-special effects for super-specific situations. Only a small set is available to purchase outright, as well - others need to be earned by completing quests or conquering challenge trials in the many shrines dotting the landscape. These are also the only truly-customizable parts of your inventory aside from the wide assortment of meals that you cook up to replenish your hearts, whether you opt to dye them (provided that you have the right to do so as not all types of armor are eligible) or simply increase their stats by interacting with the four Great Fairies residing in the most remote corners of Hyrule.
