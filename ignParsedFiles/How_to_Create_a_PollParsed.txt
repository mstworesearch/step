How to Create a Poll - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
If you need to add a poll to a wiki, use Poll Daddy. To embed a poll in a wiki you need a poll ID as well. To get the poll ID, you need to first create a poll on the Poll Daddy website. Create a login here: 
1 - Select Polls > Create a New Poll from the top menu 
2 - Enter a poll question, select the appropriate Folder, and enter the answers for users to choose from 
3 - For the Poll Style, select a Custom Style - IGN (best for short text answers), IGN Wide (best for long answers, or answers with images embedded), or GameSpy or GameSpy Wide for polls on GameSpy 
4 - Choose the poll options you want. 
5 - For Comments, make sure "No Comments" is selected. (Enabling comments would create a separate comments page hosted by Poll Daddy; we want users to use the comments on IGN) 
6 - For Sharing, make sure "Allow Sharing" is enabled. 
7 - Click "Create poll". 
8 - Copy the code from the pop-up. 
To embed a poll in a wiki, use the following code: 
Enter your poll ID number for #######. Note the slash at the end of the poll ID number -- this is essential or the poll will not embed.
