Shrines - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Shrines are smaller "mini-dungeons" that can be found throughout the open world of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There are 120 Shrines to locate and complete around the map -- each containing a a Spirit Orb. Collect 4 Spirit Orbs to expand your Heart Containers or Stamina! 
Shrines themselves differ depending on their location. Most shrines contain a small dungeon, which will usually features a central puzzle theme, and may include monsters. A few shrines focus on combat in which Link must fight a single combatant. The combat will range from easy to very difficult. 
Fewer still, are "free" shrines. Those include the shrines in the Lost Woods and the three labyrinths. These shrines contain no puzzles or monsters. The Spirit Orb (and treasure chest) are freely given due to the difficulty of reaching the shrine. 
Four special Shrines at the start of the game contain Runes that will be essential to solving the puzzles within, while other shrines contain Spirit Orbs. Note that some Shrines aren't always visible, and Link will need to undertake Shrine Quests to solve riddles to reveal their location. 
Link can trade in 4 Spirit Orbs at any Goddess Statue (located in the Temple of Time and all major towns) to gain either a new Heart Container or Stamina Vessel. 
All Shrine Locations can be seen on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Interactive Map:
