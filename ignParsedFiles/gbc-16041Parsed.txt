                                                Simultaneously released with Oracle of Ages, this second Capcom-developed Zelda game is widely regarded as the more difficult of the two adventures, Oracle of Ages sees Link embark on a similar quest to that in Oracle of Seasons, in that he must rescue a beautiful woman from the clutches of an unspeakable evil. Link's adventure begins when he awakens in a strange forest deep within the land of Labrynna. By using the Harp of Ages, Link is able to transcend the very fabric of time, allowing him to jump between the past and present as the need arises. Complete the adventure to receive a password that can be used in Oracle of Seasons.
