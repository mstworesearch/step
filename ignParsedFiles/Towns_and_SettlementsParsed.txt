Towns and Settlements - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the people of Hyrule have managed to live on past the Calamity and dwell in major Towns and Settlements across the land. 
Along with the Hylians, the other races of Hyrule: The Zora, Rito, Goron, and Gerudo all have their own towns in which they dwell. 
Towns serve as hub areas - both to advance the plot of the main quest to Free the Divine Beast, and offer a place to rest, shop for good, and obtain Side Quests and Shrine Quests by talking to the residents of the towns and settlements. 
For detailed information on what you can find in each town, see the list below:
