Link - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The hero Link is one of the confirmed characters in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Little is known about the game at this time, and more information will be added as it is revealed. 
Although bearing a heavy resemblance to Link, Eiji Aonuma stated that the character in the trailer may not be Link. Eiji Aonuma would eventually admit that the character was, in fact, Link. 
With the reveal of the supposed start of the game at E3 2016, little is known about our protagonist. Link has been asleep for 100 years, in a strange looking tomb of old technology. 
He awakens to hear the voice of Zelda beckoning him to open his eyes and save the land, to restore Hyrule. Exactly why Link was sleeping and where on the timelines this places Link is still a mystery.
