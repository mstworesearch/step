Get a Sneak Peek of Dark Horse's First Avatar Comic - IGN

Dark Horse has two big releases for this year's Free Comic Book Day. One of these issues will feature the publisher's very first Avatar comic paired with a new story set in the world of Briggs Land. The other book offers Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans a taste of the Scooby Gang's high school days and a new Plants vs. Zombie adventure.
Courtesy of Dark Horse, we have an exclusive preview of all four of these stories. Scroll down to find out what to expect from the FCBD festivities tomorrow:
Dark Horse first announced their "ten-year partnership" with director James Cameron back in October 2015. This FCBD release is the first fruit of that arrangement, with more comics planned to flesh out the Avatar universe both before and after the events of the first film.
