Big Story
The Memory 2 - Revali's Flap is one of 19 unlockable Memories in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
In order to find and view Main Quest Memories, you must unlock them by journeying to the specific place and unlocking a crucial story moment. 
This memory - not attatched to Princess Zelda, can be obtained during the main quest - Divine Beast Vah Medoh. After speaking to the Elder of Rito Village, talk to Temba's wife in the next building who will point out the landing platform. This will trigger Link's memory of the champion Revali.
