The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Empire of Tamriel is on the edge. The High King of Skyrim has been murdered. Alliances form as claims to the throne are made. In the midst of this conflict, a far more dangerous, ancient evil is awakened. 
The Dragons, long lost to the passages of the Elder Scrolls, have returned to Tamriel. The future of Skyrim, even the Empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesied Dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons.
