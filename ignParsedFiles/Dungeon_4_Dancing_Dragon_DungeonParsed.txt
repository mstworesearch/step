Dungeon 4 Dancing Dragon Dungeon - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The vast Mt. Cucco region contains a new portal to Subrosia and at its peak you'll find the Dungeon 4: Dancing Dragon Dungeon. 
The Maku Tree is dreaming of waterfalls and mountains, and that can mean only one thing... dreaming trees are creepy. You'll have to head to Mt. Cucco for the next stretch of adventure. To do this head back to the narrow bridge that connects Holodrum Plain to North Horon. Use your map to locate these regions if you're having problems. Just to the east of here, you will find a hole under a hollow log. Jump over the hole with the Feather and head through the log.
