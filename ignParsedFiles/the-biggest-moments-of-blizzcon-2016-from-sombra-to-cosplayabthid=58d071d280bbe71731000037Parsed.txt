After a months-long build up, Blizzard finally announced Sombra as the newest character to join Overwatch. The reaction during BlizzCon's opening ceremony was deafening as she hacked into the presentation, immediately bursting with personality and complexity like the rest of Overwatch's colorful cast of characters.
New gameplay showed off all of Sombra's abilities, which -- appropriately -- lean into her hacker skillset. Luckily, she lived up to our high expectations after all that hype. Check out our impressions from 15 minutes with Sombra:

Itching for that vanilla Diablo experience? Fortunately, you're going to get just that in the upcoming Darkening of Tristom Diablo 3 anniversary patch. The area features the four main bosses from the first game, the original music, and graphics filters to make Diablo III look like the original, with the dungeon being 16 levels deep, and player character movement again limited to eight directions.
It's an exciting move for Diablo 3, and one that was the talk of BlizzCon. The original Diablo experience will be playable in PTR starting this week.

Varian Wrynn and Ragnaros will soon be playable in Heroes of the Storm! Varian will be the game's first multi-class hero, able to fight as a shield-wielding tank or a deadly assassin based on the player's choices. And of course Ragnaros's addition offers a fun twist on the World of Warcraft boss, making him a playable character for the first time.
Heroes of the Storm players won't need to wait long to get their hands on these two new character, with Varian coming to PTR this week and then officially during the week of November 15, and Ragnaros being introduced to the game in December.

Hearthstone's new expansion is the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, but that's not even the most exciting news about the latest addition to the game. Instead, the talk of BlizzCon was Gadgetzan's addition of tri-class cards, which allow specific cards to work for multiple classes.
This fourth Hearthstone expansion adds 132 new cards and will debut in early December. In keeping with the theme, it features three city factions: The Grimy Goons for Hunters, Paladins, and Warriors, the Kabal for Mages, Priests, and Warlocks, and the Jade Lotus for Druids, Rogues, and Shamans.

Blizzard got a jump on the competitive side of Overwatch by announcing an Overwatch League for pro-level competitions. The developer is treating the league like a professional sports league, with players eligible for contracts, including minimum guaranteed salaries as well as benefits. The inaugural season will begin in 2017, and Blizzard will host a combine for players to join professional teams. The general consensus was it's a smart move for the company, especially given the rise of esports in recent years.
