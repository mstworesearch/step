Far Cry 5 Teasers Confirm American Setting, Full Reveal This Week - IGN

Four new teasers have been released for Far Cry 5, confirming that the game will take place in the US - specifically the state of Montana - for the first time in the series' history.
The short trailers end with a message saying that the game will be revealed this Friday, May 26.
Each one shows an image of rural America, then puncture the peace with an unsettling image (the man being used as a face-based bellringer is pretty unpleasant):
They also seem to counter rumours that said the game would take place in a Wild West setting (which would put it in more direct competition with this year's Red Dead Redemption 2) - clothing, weapons and buildings look more modern than the Old West would suggest.
