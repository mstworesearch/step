Gunrunning - GTA 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on the Gunrunning update for GTA Online in Grand Theft Auto 5. 
Announced on May 25, 2017, Gunrunning will be the 18th major update for Grand Theft Auto Online. 
As implied by the title, the Gunrunning update is all about the arms trade. It focuses on smuggling high-value weapons around southern San Andreas, as well as amassing and customizing a wide array of weaponized vehicles. 
Players who have already become a CEO, Biker Club or VIP can purchase underground bunkers in the Grand Senora desert to use as a base of operations and build a small arms manufacturing outfit. 
In addition to GTA$, players can also unlock new upgrades and modifications for weapons and vehicles. 
The Gunrunning update introduces two new locations that can be purchased by aspiring arms dealers: a bunker and a Mobile Operations Center. 
The bunker is a large underground base, complete with living quarters and storage - you MOC can also be kept here - also contains workshops for you to upgrade and customize your weapons and vehicles. 
The Mobile Ops Center is a customizable oversided tractor-trailer, which not only allows players to begin new jobs on the go but also can be outfitted with a living area and weapons / vehicle workshops. 
These new vehicles are rides that, as indicated, are able to be fitted with powerful weapons and armor. 
These can range from a dune buggy with a mounted machine gun to an amphibious APC and even a trailer equipped with anti-aircraft guns. These vehicles, it seems, can be purchased and upgraded in bunkers and via the Mobile Ops Center.
