Channel Surfing #274: Netflix's New Cancellation Era and Twin Peaks Reaction - IGN

We're back! And it's been less than two weeks since our last episode! What sorcery is this?! 
This shockingly quick installment mainly focuses on two things: Netflix and Twin Peaks. Regarding the former, we discuss the recent cancellations of The Get Down and Sense8 and how it seems to be a new era for the streaming juggernaut, as they finally begin acting like a regular TV outlet - who can't keep every single series going. 
As for Twin Peaks, as uber-fans of the original series, we have plenty of thoughts about the long-awaited revival, having now seen the first four hours. 
Plus, we sneak in a little news about Game of Thrones and Tales from The Crypt!
