Dragons - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Three Dragons are found in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. They areancient and primordial spirits that take the form of incredibly huge and powerful dragons that cannot be harmed by mere mortals. 
These dragons each serve the goddesses and are associated with each of the ancient springs. 
Soon after starting your adventures beyond the Great Plateau, you may be lucky enough to witness one of these ancient spirits making its way across the land of Hyrule. These dragons are not explicitly aggressive, but they do have certain defenses to ward off the unworthy. When a dragon appear close, the music will change, and large updrafts will appear around the dragon, letting Link use his Paraglider to move in close with unlimited stamina. However, each dragon will also summon elemental orbs that can strike Link and cause damage - making him fall out of the sky. Each dragon can be found in a different part of Hyrule, usually beginning their flight around sunrise and finish around sunset.
