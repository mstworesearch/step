Marvel's Agents of SHIELD Clip: Will Daisy Have to Abandon a Friend in the Framework?  - IGN

On the last episode of Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, we learned that Aida was attempting to build herself a human form so that she could finally overcome her programming to protect humanity.
In this week's new episode, "Farewell, Cruel World!" -- airing Tuesday, May 2nd -- Jemma finally fills Daisy in on Aida's scheme while Daisy informs her about Radcliffe's back door to the Framework.
In this exclusive scene from the episode, the two of them realize that it may be impossible to save everyone as one of their close friends, within the Framework, is still a top Hydra operative. Take a look!
The official synopsis for "Farewell, Cruel World!" reads:
"Daisy and Simmons rush to get the team out of the Framework, but not everyone is ready and willing to leave."
Marvel's Agents of SHIELD airs Tuesdays at 10/9c on ABC.
