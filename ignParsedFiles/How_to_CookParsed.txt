How to Cook - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Cooking is an essential activity in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. While exploring, Link must collect materials and ingredients from the world in order to make nutritious meals to refill his heart containers. Sometimes, a meal or elixer is needed to grant Link cold, fire, or lighting resistance so he can safely travel extreme terrain if he doesn't have the tunic for it. Some food grants extra buffs as well, like heightened stealth or increased attack. 
Some of these ingredients can be consumed raw in order to heal, but to get the most out of your food, and to receive any buffs, you must cook it first.
