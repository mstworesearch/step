Updates - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page documents any post-release Updates that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild receives, and any noteworthy patch notes or hidden changes that are made to the game. Nintendo has been notoriously vague about what their updates actually do, see below for details on what we know has changed. 
According to users, the Infinite Arrow Exploit has been patched. Before Update 1.1.2, there was an exploit where you could stand in front of enemy archers and while standing still they would shoot the area around you - letting you get unlimited arrows. This has now been changed, and arrows will stop appearing after around 20 or so. Users can still reset this by fast traveling elsewhere. 
Another stealth update according to users, A glitch was fixed where Wolf Link would be summoned with more than his default 3 hearts - even if the user had not completed the Cave of Trials in Twilight Princess HD. Ordinarily, you would have to complete the Cave of Trials, and the amount of hearts that Wolf Link retained would transfer to how many your companion would have in Breath of the Wild. 
According to Eurogamer and Digital Foundry, the framerate has been improved slightly on the Nintendo Switch version of Breath of the Wild. However, the Wii U did not appear to receive the same framerate fixes.
