Wonder Woman First Reactions Twitter Roundup - IGN

Several members of the press had the opportunity to see Wonder Woman early, and while reviews won't go live until the very end of the month, the embargo for social media reactions lifted last night and the general response has been very positive.
In fact, IGN's very own Terri Schwartz saw the film early and shared her thoughts on Twitter, saying she thinks it's the best of the DCEU films yet.
