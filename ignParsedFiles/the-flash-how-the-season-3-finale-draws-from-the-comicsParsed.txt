The Flash's Season 3 finale ended with what could wind up being the show's most status quo-altering twist yet, as Barry Allen retreated into the Speed Force to pay his penance for creating the Flashpoint timeline and Savitar. The rest of Team Flash will have to carry on in his absence in Season 4. Depending how far the writers are willing to take this new development, we could be looking at a fourth season driven not by Grant Gustin's Barry Allen, but by Keiynan Lonsdale's Wally West.
This twist definitely has a precedent in the comics, however. And based on that source material, we have a few ideas of what to expect from the series when it picks back up in Season 4.

Since the series first revealed Eobard Thawne's hidden room in STAR Labs, viewers have been treated to glimpses of a holographic newspaper from the year 2024 with the ominous headlines "FLASH MISSING" and "VANISHES IN CRISIS" plastered on the front, along with another article titled "RED SKIES VANISH." Those headlines basically sum up what happened at the end of this episode. It seems that the "crisis" in question came about seven years sooner than expected. Which makes sense given that Barry and his friends managed to defeat Savitar years earlier than they were meant to.
Comic book readers have always taken those headlines to be references to the epic 1985 crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths. In that crossover, an all-powerful villain called the Anti-Monitor began devouring the entire multiverse, causing red skies to appear on countless worlds. By the time the heroes of a few surviving worlds halted the Anti-Monitor's path of destruction, the multiverse had collapsed into one, unified DC Universe. And Barry Allen was among a number of iconic heroes who died saving the day.
This particular Crisis has nothing to do with the multiverse as far as we can tell, but it did have the same end result as far as The Flash is concerned. In both cases, Barry Allen sacrificed himself for the sake of his allies and was consumed by the Speed Force. And now Wally West faces the difficult task of filling Barry's shoes and becoming the one and only Flash of his world. Though there's no guarantee the series won't eventually tackle a conflict more directly inspired by Crisis on Infinite Earths. That would be good fodder for another four-way Arrowverse crossover...
