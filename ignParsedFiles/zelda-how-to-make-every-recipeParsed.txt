All Recipes and Cookbook - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Cooking in Breath of the Wild is extensive, but there's no sort of in-game system to track recipes. You can find recipes throughout Hyrule on banners and learn them from various NPCs. 
Below are various cooked food recipes. Please refer to the rest of the guide for information on which items can add an effect. Some of these recipes don't include substitutions. 
These recipes are generally pretty flexible, so be sure to use ingredients with effects to get the most out of your meal. 
The following entree dishes don't use any meat and a majority can be altered to give extra effects. 
These are the dishes that'll make the best use of all the fish and crustaceans in Hyrule. If you're having trouble finding Hearty Salmon, try looking for it in the southern part of Herba Plunge just north of the Rito Stable in the Herba region. 
Make use of all the meat you've collected with these recipes. If you're having trouble finding Raw Whole Bird or Raw Bird Thighs, trying looking for the emu-like birds in the Eldin Canyon and around Death Mountain 
These recipes mix land and sea ingredients to create bountiful dishes.
