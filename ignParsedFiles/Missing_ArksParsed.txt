Missing Arks - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on the missing arks that can be found throughout Mass Effect: Andromeda. 
In addition to Ark Hyperion, which house the majority of the Human population traveling to the Heleus Cluster, there were also three other ark ships that were supposed to rendezvous with the Nexus upon arrival. 
There was Ark Natanus, the Turian ark, Ark Leusinia for the Asari, and the Salaria ark Paarchero. 
Sadly Hyperion was the only ark to return to the Nexus, more than a year overdue itself. Ryder can endeavor to find these missing arks if they so choose.
