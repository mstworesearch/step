How to Farm Star Fragments - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
As you progress in the game, you will soon come to realize that a Star Fragment or two is necessary to upgrade armor to the max. 
Remember that Central Tower has Guardians at it's base, so be careful when warping there. Also, monsters come out at night so use your paraglider or switch to your Dark Armor Set (Dark Hood, Dark Tunic, and Dark Trousers) so you can run faster.
