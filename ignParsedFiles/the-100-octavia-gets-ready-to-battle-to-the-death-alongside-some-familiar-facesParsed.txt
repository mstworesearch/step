The 100: Octavia Gets Ready to Battle to the Death Alongside Some Familiar Faces - IGN

The situation on The 100 has grown more dire than ever, as a meltdown of all of the Earth's remaining nuclear power plants threaten to kill everyone still alive. Last week, we saw that desperate times called for desperate measures yet again, as it was decided that a new Conclave would be held, in which a Champion from each clan would battle to the death, until only one remained - with the winner's people being the ones who get to survive in the bunker that's recently been discovered, which can save a limited number.
IGN has an exclusive clip for you from the next episode, "Die All, Die Merrily," as Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) prepares to fight for Skaikru, joining Roan (Zach McGowan) from Azgeda and a couple other participants she didn't expect to see... including one who no one expected to join this fight.
The official description for the episode ominously reads:
Octavia fights in the final battle for her people's survival, but not everyone is willing to play fair.
I've seen this episode and can say it is one of the show's most intense and harrowing ever. Look for my full review on IGN immediately after it airs on the east coast.

The 100: "Die All, Die Merrily" airs Wednesday, May 3rd on the CW.
