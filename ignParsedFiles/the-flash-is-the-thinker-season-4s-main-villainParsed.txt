The Flash: Is the Thinker, aka "DeVoe," Season 4's Main Villain? - IGN

While most of the chatter surrounding The Flash's Season 3 finale surrounds the shocking, status quo-altering ending, that wasn't the only big development to be found in that episode. Savitar may have given fans a major clue as to which DC villain will be headlining the upcoming fourth season. And as promised, this villain won't be another evil speedster, but rather a shadowy criminal mastermind known as The Thinker.

"Finish Line" is actually the second episode this season where one of Barry Allen's time-traveling enemies has referenced a character named DeVoe. Earlier, Abra Kadabra spoke of DeVoe in the same breath as Reverse-Flash and Zoom, implying that this villain is in their league in terms of power and overall threat level. And in "Finish Line," Savitar reminisced about building a machine to stop DeVoe's telekinetic powers before reminding himself that Team Flash circa-2017 has yet to encounter this enemy. It would seem the writers are laying the seeds for their next major villain much in the same way Arrow set the stage for Damien Darhk in late Season 3. Here's where we think the show might be headed with DeVoe as its main antagonist in Season 4.

The "DeVoe" in question is Clifford DeVoe, the first of several DC villains to call themselves "The Thinker." This disgraced ex-lawyer built a new career for himself as a sort of adviser to other criminals, reasoning that they had the drive but not the intelligence to dominate the city's criminal underworld. That naturally put him in constant conflict with original Flash Jay Garrick.
DeVoe became a real threat to Flash once he built himself a "Thinking Cap," a device that granted him the ability to control minds and levitate objects. So while DeVoe is shaping up to be the first non-speedster villain to headline a season, he certainly has enough power to take on heroes like Wally West and Jay Garrick.
