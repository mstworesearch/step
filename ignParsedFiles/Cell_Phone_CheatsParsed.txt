Cell Phone Cheats - GTA 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains all known Cell Phone Cheats in GTA 5. For a list of button-input cheats check out Cheats and Secrets. 
Cell phone cheats (similar to the ones from GTA IV) make their debut in Grand Theft Auto 5's release on the PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Unlike in GTA IV however, cheats are not saved to the phone's menu once entered - they must be re-keyed each time you want to use them.
