Xbox: Developers Can Choose Higher Framerates for Scorpio Versions, Even in Multiplayer - IGN

Microsoft has clarified how it will approach the power disparity between Xbox One and its upcoming Scorpio upgrade when it comes to frame rate and resolution.
As noted by GameSpot, Xbox corporate vice president Mike Ybarra sparked conversation by tweeting: "Developers are free to choose how they use the power of Project Scorpio for games. We have no requirements limiting framerate or fidelity."
This led to a question regarding parity of framerates between the same game playing on Xbox One and Scorpio, particularly in multiplayer (where differing framerates can make a definable alteration in quality of play). Ybarra made clear that, if they wanted, developers could allow for different framerates between consoles, even in multiplayer.
No, there isn't. This is up to the developer to choose, for their games, what they want to do. https://t.co/bFW7gcni7d
