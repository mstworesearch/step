Nintendo Switch Classic Game Selection Not Replacing Virtual Console - IGN

While Nintendo plans to offer a selection of classic games as part of its paid online service for Switch, it won't serve as a replacement for Virtual Console.
"Classic Games Selection (tentative name) is different from the [Virtual Console]," a Nintendo rep told Famitsu (translation via Polygon). According to the rep, the company's schedule for selling Virtual Console games is "still undecided."
