Orphan Black Final Season Sneak Peek: Sarah and Mika Switch Places - IGN

The final season of Orphan Black is debuting soon and we've got an exclusive clip from Season 5 - once more showing off the formidable talent of both Tatiana Maslany and the show's special effect team when it comes to creating the clones at the center of the series.
In the following scene, Sarah (Maslany) and Mika (also Maslany) need to make a very quick switch up and pose as one another, as part of Sarah's quest to get back her daughter, Kira. Take note of the fact that the scene is all done in one shot, swiftly panning around the room -- and the two Maslanys -- in a fascinating technical feat.
Orphan Black: Season 5 debuts June 10th on BBC America.
