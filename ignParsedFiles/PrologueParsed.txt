Prologue - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The beginning of story mode is a prologue that gives some background info on the Tekken storyline, as well as set up the plot for Tekken 7. When you finally start controlling a character after the cutscene, you'll be playing as a young Kazuya. All you have to do is keep hitting young Heihachi. You won't do a lot of damage, but will do something to progress along. 
Every now and then, Heihachi will smack Kazuya away and deal massive damage to you. This is suppose to happen. When you get knocked back, recover and continue attacking Heihachi until you get knocked down again and trigger another cutscene. 
You'll see Heihachi standing over a cliff with Kazuya in hand. Hit the prompted button to thrown Kazuya down the cliff. This will trigger another cutscene, which will play through till the end of the chapter.
