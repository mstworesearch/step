Logan Blu-ray Combo Pack
Here's a good place to start: the Logan Blu-ray Combo Pack. It's the combo pack you've come to know and love, but in Logan form! You get 3 options: Blu-ray, DVD, and a digital version, so there's really no excuse not to watch it on some device in your house. You could dust off the old PS2 and give it some love, if that's your thing.

Logan 4K Blu-ray Combo Pack
If ultra high definition is your thing, the Logan 4K Blu-ray Combo Pack is here to bathe your eyes in the best possible consumer-available resolution. It ups the ante with a regular, HD Blu-ray, as well, and it doesn't skimp on the digital, tossing in a high definition download, as well.
