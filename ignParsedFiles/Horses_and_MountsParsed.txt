Horses and Mounts - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are more than just basic horses to find in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
Wild Horses are found in many places - from the fields of Central Hyrule, to the grasslands of the Dueling Peak and around Lake Hylia, all the way to the plains in Akkala or the snowy tundras of the Hebra Mountains and beyond. The stats of the horse may improve if you venture into dangerous areas - but you'll never know how good your horse is until you register them. Their stats can be as low as one star or as high as four in any category.
