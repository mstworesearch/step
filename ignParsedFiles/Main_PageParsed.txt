Big Story
Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action game with RPG elements set in a post-post-apocalyptic world. In it, mankind has reverted back to a tribal state after a near-extinction event, while machines with artificial intelligence have "evolved" to resemble prehistoric beasts. Players take on the role of Aloy, a young warrior woman, as she strives to find her place in this new world and uncover the secrets the old one left behind.
