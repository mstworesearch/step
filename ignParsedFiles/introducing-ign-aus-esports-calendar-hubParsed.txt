Introducing IGN AU's Esports Calendar Hub - IGN

Greetings, fellow esports fans and welcome to a new project we're undertaking here at IGN Australia - our Esports Calendar/Hub.
We've created this space to provide Aussie esports fanatics with a way to quickly find out about local esports events. That means dates and times for streams where you can watch the best teams in the country compete, or sign-up information for events you might want to participate in. We've also slotted in details of Aussie teams competing abroad, and of course there are some major esports events we couldn't leave off the list.
If you're looking for the best way to watch Aussie team Blank Esports compete in the Overwatch Pacific Championship, you're wondering when League of Legends' OPL Split two begins or you're hoping to see Aussie Dota beasts kpii and ana duke it out in Manila, our calendar hub is here and has the details.
