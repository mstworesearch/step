The Final Club Nintendo Elite Status Rewards Are Here - IGN

The Club Nintendo Elite Status gifts are here, and as suspected, they are all-digital. The available options are both full-retail Wii U and 3DS games, along with Virtual Console classics.
Platinum members, those who were able to scrape together the requisite 600 coins before Club Nintendo stopped accepting new registrations yesterday, can choose from a full list of downloadable games, while Gold members can choose from roughly half as many as those who achieved the Platinum dream.

Galaxy 2 and Punch-Out!! are actually the Wii titles that were recently introduced by Nintendo as downloadable titles for the Wii U. The following games are available to both Gold and Platinum members:
If you haven't yet cashed in your coins for prizes, you still have until June 30 to spend them. But new codes are no longer being accepted, so if you missed your chance to achieve Platinum dreams, you're sadly out of luck.
