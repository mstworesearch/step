TGS 2016: Musou Stars Announced for PS4 and PS Vita - IGN

A new title that mixes much of Koei Tecmo's IP was unveiled today on stage at Tokyo Game Show.
Musou Stars looks to be the Japanese publisher's answer to Smash Bros, cramming characters from popular series like Ninja Gaiden and Atelier under one banner.
Not much was revealed apart from a brief introductory trailer, and the fact that it will launch some time in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and PS Vita.
It's not clear how (or if) it will differ from Warriors Orochi, Koei Tecmo's previous franchise mash-up series.
During the conference, Square Enix also whipped the cloak off a new Final Fantasy 15 Lunar Edition PS4 which will launch on the game's release date, November 29.
