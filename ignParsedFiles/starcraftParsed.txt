StarCraft Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
StarCraft is a RTS game released for the PC and Nintendo 64. It follows the events of a fictional universe, as three different races struggle for survival against one another and an even greater looming threat. 
StarCraft features a lengthy campaign, split into 3 sections (6 if you have the Brood War expansion). Each section focuses on one of the races at a time before moving on to the next. 
StarCraft also features a robust multiplayer mode where players can play normal and custom games over Battle.net. It also has a built in Map Editor, allowing users to easily create custom maps and units.
