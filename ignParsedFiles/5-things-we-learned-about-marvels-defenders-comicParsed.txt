5 Things We Learned About Marvel's Defenders Comic - IGN

Writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist David Marquez have been working at the forefront of the Marvel Universe in the past couple years, first establishing a new status quo for Tony Stark in Invincible Iron Man and then tearing the Avengers down the middle in Civil War II. For their next collaboration, Bendis and Marquez are delivering a new take on the Defenders, one that clearly shares a few things in common with the upcoming Netflix show.
Marvel held one of their "Next Big Thing" press calls on Tuesday to shed more light on the new Defenders comic. Both Bendis and Marquez were in attendance, as was Executive Editor Tom Brevoort. Check out this preview art Marvel provided, and then scroll down to find out what was revealed during the call and why fans shouldn't assume this book is a simple cash-in on the Netflix series.

With the team roster being what it is in this series, there's no denying the fact that Defenders is banking on the excitement for Netflix's upcoming Defenders TV series. But Bendis reminded those on the call that he actually set the stage for this series way back in his New Avengers run. All four main characters were included in New Avengers Vol. 2, and the series ended in 2012 with a tease for a potential Heroes for Hire spinoff. Five years later, Defenders is basically making good on that promise, albeit with a different team name.
