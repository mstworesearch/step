Tokyo 42 Review - IGN

When played strictly as a stealth game, Tokyo 42 is a total blast. As a killer for hire in the stylish, high-contrast high rise setting of future Tokyo, I delighted in silently slashing guards with my katana blade on my way to take out a mob boss in the top floor of a beautifully ornate temple or plant a series of explosives along a tangle of factory pipelines. Unfortunately, once my cover was blown and the shooting started, Tokyo 42 became a wildly inconsistent experience thanks to targeting controls that miss when they seem like they should hit and AI that hits when it seems like it should miss. And in a game where you can be killed with only one shot, you really need the controls to work for you rather than against you.
