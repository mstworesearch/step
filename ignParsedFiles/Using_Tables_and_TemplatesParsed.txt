Using Tables and Templates - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Tables are best created from the Rich Text editor, although users familiar with the wiki-code may create them raw. Note that the reddish color of the first row is preferable for headers (both column and row). 
The following are templates for different table types (they may be changed as the need for each wiki changes). Copy the code for these into your wiki and go nuts!
