Farpoint Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Farpoint is an upcoming game revealed at E3 2016. It's a FPS VR game that seems to be set in space. In the brief teaser, we were shown people walking across a planet and discovering a very large, very angry creature. 
 


What little we know, is that your character works for the United Earth Project. The two main characters appear to be Dr.Tyson and Dr.Moon. It looks like you'll be tasked with surviving on this barren planet, looking for clues as to what is going on. 
As for what you will be facing, that isn't entirely clear yet. We do know there are some angry creatures on this planet that will act as Enemies, as we saw a very large crab like monster towards the end of the trailer. 
Farpoint requires you use the new PlayStation VR Aim controller. Unlike the Sharpshooter where a Move controller was needed to get the controller working, the VR Aim comes with built in motion and navigation sensors. 
 
Its 1-to-1 tracking allows you to point in a particular spot or angle in the real world to have your virtual gun point at a target in the game at the same time.
