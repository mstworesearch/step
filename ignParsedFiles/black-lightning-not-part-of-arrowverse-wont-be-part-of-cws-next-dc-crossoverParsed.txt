Black Lightning Not Part of Arrowverse, Won't Be Part of CW's Next DC Crossover - IGN

Greg Berlanti's upcoming DC series Black Lightning is not set within the The CW's Arrowverse.
As reported by Entertainment Weekly, The CW president Mark Pedowitz confirmed today, prior to the network's upfront presentation, that Black Lighting is not part of The CW's shared DC universe, and as such won't be part of its next DC crossover.
"We do not aim to do a five-way crossover," Pedowitz told reporters. "Black Lightning, at this time, is not part of the Arrowverse. It is a separate situation. But there will be a big fourth quarter crossover with all four of the shows that are on in the fall."
It's worth noting that all of The CW's Arrowverse shows film in Vancouver, while production on Black Lightning takes place in Atlanta. Couple that with the fact that Black Lightning won't debut until midseason, and one can see why Berlanti's new show doesn't share a universe with the rest of The CW's DC lineup.
