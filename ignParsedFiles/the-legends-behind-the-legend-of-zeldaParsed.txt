The Legends Behind The Legend of Zelda - IGN

March 3rd, 2016: To celebrate the return of Twilight Princess, now in HD on Wii U, we look back at the creative minds behind the epic franchise.
The biggest names behind The Legend of Zelda need little introduction. Any fan of the series, indeed any follower of the game industry on the whole, knows about Shigeru Miyamoto. By the same stroke, Eiji Aonuma is established far and wide as the second biggest name in Zelda history, having risen from the somewhat obscure Marvelous: Another Treasure Island to direct and produce many games in the series. Takashi Tezuka is another major talent, known for his influence on both Mario and Zelda games. And any Zelda follower could extoll the talents of composer Koji Kondo, whose music was part of the series since the original The Legend of Zelda hit the Famicom Disk System in 1986.
