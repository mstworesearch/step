Mementos and Requests - Persona 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The following is IGN's guide to Mementos and Requests that can be done inside of it in Persona 5. 
Requests are usually obtained through the Phansite and sent to you by Mishima. These requests have you go into Mementos and track down lesser Shadows who are causing problems for people without being so distorted that they create Palaces. 
Some requests are also obtained through Confidants and they will be listed separately. 
To start, requests have you go into Mementos. Mementos is made up of eight different areas and each area opens up to you after you beat a Palace. 
The letters in parentheses beside the path names are what we will use to indicate request locations below. For example, the first request in the list below is on the Path of Qimranut: Area 1, but we've shortened that to Q:1. 
What comes below the final floor of Mementos can be discovered through the story. 
Requests have a strange quirk to them, though. The Shadow you face during them does not have the same weaknesses (if any) as the Shadow it looks like. For example, if you fight a Shadow that looks like Jack Frost, which should have a weakness to Fire and a resistance to Ice, it probably won't have those. The Shadow's appearance is purely an aesthetic choice. 
The following are regular requests that you'll get throughout the game. Make sure to read Mishima's texts in order to unlock them.
