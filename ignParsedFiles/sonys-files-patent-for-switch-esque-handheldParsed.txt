Sony Files Patent for What Looks Like a Switch-esque Handheld - IGN

It looks like Sony may be taking cues from Nintendo, as the PlayStation manufacturer has filed a patent for what looks like a new Switch-inspired handheld device.
As spotted by NeoGAF user ponpo, the patent was filed back in 2015 but was only just recently published. While the controller pieces on the side look as though they may be detachable, they aren't explicitly shown as being removable from the device.

Like Nintendo Switch, the device looks very much like a tablet with two controller halves on either side, but instead of Joy-Cons flanking the screen, the half-controllers on either side of the device look like the handles on a DualShock 4.
