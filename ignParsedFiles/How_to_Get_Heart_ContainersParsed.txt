How to Get Heart Containers - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you will soon find that Heart Pieces (Pieces of Heart) do not exist in Hyrule, and you won't be able to find and increase your hearts by traditional means. 

That's because there aren't any. Instead, you can gain additional Heart Containers by beating each of the four main bosses or by praying to any of the Goddess Statues in the main towns and the Temple of Time. These statues also appear in Kakariko Village, Hateno Village, Zora's Domain, Goron City, Rito Village, and Gerudo Town - and often emit a glow from a distance. 
In exchange for 4 Spirit Orbs gained by completing Shrines, you'll be able to claim either a new Heart Container or Stamina Vessel. 
If the enemies you're fighting seem too tough, or you need to prove your inner power, be sure to go hunting for Shrines to increase your stats.
