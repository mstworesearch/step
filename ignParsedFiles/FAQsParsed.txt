FAQs - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
IGN has moved everything (FAQs included!) to a new publishing system. While the look may be a little bit different, the old adages still hold true -- FAQs are left in plain text (more or less). Ads, as always, are disabled on all "FAQ" submissions. 
The old webform is no longer supported. However, updates and new guides may be sent by email attachment (faqsign.com) or dropped into the FTP (in a folder with your name and date on it - e.g., sng 2012 june 18) 
ftp://clubign_guest:sendfaqs@xfer.ign.comUser clubign_guestPass sendfaqs 
You may view the latest submissions here. IGN thanks you for your patronage. 
If you do not see your FAQ listed with IGN after a period of 24 hours after your submission, you should immediately contact faqsign.com 
Remember FAQ submissions received prior to 4 P.M. Pacific Standard Time can be approved the same day, Monday to Friday. No updates occur on Saturdays or Sundays, as well as any widely recognized holidays in the United States. 
If you have further questions, comments, or suggested improvements for the site or IGN in general, contact the staff at: faqsign.com . Copies of new FAQs and FAQ updates are accepted at this address as well.
