Activities - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There's a lot that can be done in Horizon: Zero Dawn. Activities are just one of the many distractions that can yield loot, or more information about the world. Below are all the activities, and what they do for you. 
These are, as you would expect, camps full of Bandits. Simply walk to them on the map, kill all the enemies inside and you will finish the camp. You're reward is the loot they drop, and a decent amount of XP. 
These robotic strongholds are special areas where you must fight and solve puzzles while venturing deeper into a robot production facility. At the core will be a large machine, and once dead, you can unlock new powers. These upgrade your staff, allowing you to Override more machines. 
Much like Bandit Camps, these are areas marked on the map where Corrupted Machines live. Go in, kill them all and you will clear the zone. Your reward for doing so will be loot and a lot of XP. 
There are 5 hunting grounds located around the map. Each one has 3 different puzzles/battles to win. Beat them all, and you can unlock special new weapons from the Hunters Lodge in Meridian. These are also great for XP, offering huge rewards for completion. 
Scattered around the map are giant machines called Tallnecks. Climb up them, hack into them to learn the data they hold and you will complete that Tallneck. Do this to all of them to unlock map visibility and locations.
