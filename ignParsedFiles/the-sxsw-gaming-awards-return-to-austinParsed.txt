Partner Content by SXSW

The movers and shakers of the gaming industry are descending on the Austin Convention Center from March 16-18, 2017 and the best place to meet them is at SXSW Gaming. For three days, IGN will be in the thick of it, covering the newest console, mobile, esports, tabletop gaming, comics, anime, AAA, and indie video games that the innovators of gaming culture have to offer.
  
The Nintendo Switch will also be making a stop at the SXSW Gaming Expo, where the Big N is taking up some serious floor space to showcase their launch titles and accessories for the next generation console.
