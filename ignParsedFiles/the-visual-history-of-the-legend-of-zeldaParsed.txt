The Visual History of The Legend of Zelda - IGN

Nintendo's Legend of Zelda is one of the most long-running and storied franchises in video game history.
And while that longevity is impressive on its own, Zelda is especially notable thanks to Nintendo's ceaseless dedication to quality. Although some entries shine brighter than others, there's simply never been a bad main-line Zelda game - in almost 30 years. Pretty incredible.
Visually, Nintendo seems to have no interest in changing some of Zelda's most iconic elements. Link is still Link, green tunic and all. But besides of a few key icons, the company largely seems willing to reinvent Zelda's visual identity time and time again. From 2D to 3D and back, from pixels to 3D, to toon Link and back to realism, almost every Zelda game is instantly recognizable thanks to its visuals alone. Let's take a look:

The Legend of Zelda on the NES might not look like much today, but many of the enemy designs, and of course Link himself, are still being drawn from to this day.

Zelda II added an experimental 2D side-scrolling viewpoint for exploring dungeons and towns. Whether it worked effectively or not depends on who you ask.

A Link to the Past returned to the classic overhead Zelda perspective, but with far more personality and detail thanks to the power of the still-new SNES. Gamers are still questioning why Nintendo gave Link pink hair, though. Or is it the brim of his hat? The debate rages.
