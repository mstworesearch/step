Call of Duty: WWII Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
WW2 (World War 2) is the 2017 entry in the long-running Call of Duty franchise, and the 13th core game in the series (there are now seventeen including the various PC and console exclusives and expansions). 
 


Returning from the future to their historic roots, WW2 focuses on the conflict between Allied and Axis powers between 1938 and 1945. Instead of taking on the role of multiple different Allied soldiers across all of the theatres of the war, players will instead find themselves inhabiting the boots of a single U.S. army recruit as they fight through Operation Overlord and across the western front of the war.
