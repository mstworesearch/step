Square Enix to 'Remain Tenacious' in eSports Involvement - IGN

Square Enix has made a few attempts to breach the eSports bubble, and in an investor briefing president Yosuke Matsuda discussed their current efforts in the eSports landscape.
The November 6 briefing highlighted that Square's efforts on PC eSports games in Japan had been "struggling to produce adequate earnings."
"We are less-experienced in the new genre of e-sports, which prevented us from gaining player acceptance in some cases," Matsuda said.
Still, Matsuda reinforced the company's plans to enter the eSports realm.
