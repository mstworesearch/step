James Cameron on Bringing Avatar to Life at Disney World and the Wait for the Sequels - IGN

James Cameron has big, big plans for Avatar, as he gets ready to begin shooting four sequels that will follow up the story told in the 2009 film - which is still the highest-grossing movie ever released. But that's hardly all that's going on for Avatar, as this past weekend saw the opening of Pandora: The World of Avatar, an entire themed land at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom that is based around the film.
At the opening event for Pandora, I spoke to Cameron about this massive undertaking, which includes an incredibly impressive ride, Flight of Passage. We also discussed how the theme park can help his cast, as they prepare to film the sequels, and whether he's concerned over how long it will take for the first follow-up to open.
IGN: You got to sort of dip your toe into the theme park world with T2 3-D: Battle Across Time at Universal many years ago, but getting to be a part of creating this entire Pandora land, is it kind of a dream come true to see your vision come to life like this?
