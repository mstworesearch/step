Major Choices - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page catalogues the consequences of the many important decisions that Ryder will have to make during their adventure as Pathfinder in the Heleus Cluster. 
This is the first important choice Ryder will have to make on their journey - whether to turn the Prodromos outpost on Eos into a peaceful community dedicated to scientific research, or a well-stocked military outpost that serves as a forward operating base to the system. 
The consequences of this decision are not far-reaching, but send an important message to both the colonists of the Andromeda Initiative and any native species who may be watching about what the intentions of Milky Way settlers may be in this galaxy. 
After rescuing the Angaran Moshae, Ryder must decide whether or not to destroy the Kett processing facility or to take the time to rescue the Angaran prisoners before the Kett re-take the base. 
This decision will result in the death of many Angarans - though how Angaran they still are may be debatable - and Ryder's choice will affect how many people view them as a leader. 
If the facility is destroyed, Jaal is upset with Ryder for not preventing avoidable deaths; however the Moshae is grateful that Ryder acted decisively and eliminated this threat to her people. 
Conversely, if Ryder opts to attempt a rescue for the Angaran prisoners, Jaal is glad for this outcome and the Moshae is upset. She threatens not the allow Ryder into Aya's vault, but eventually concedes after admitting it would be an irrational decision.
