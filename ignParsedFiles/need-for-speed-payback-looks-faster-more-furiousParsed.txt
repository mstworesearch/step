Need for Speed Payback Looks Faster, More Furious - IGN

Ghost Games and EA have today announced Need for Speed Payback, coming to Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 10. Set in and around a desert casino town dubbed Fortune Valley, players will race and pull off heists as three separate characters united against a local criminal cartel that runs the city. Ghost has added off-road driving to the mix and is promising the deepest customization in the series to date.
