The Best Gaming Mouse for 2017 - IGN

There are few relationships in the PC gaming world that are as important as the one between a gamer and his or her mouse. That's why it's so important to pick the absolute best gaming mouse. It's the most direct connection you have to whatever game you're playing (no offense to the keyboards reading this). On top of the amount of time spent holding it, the mouse also plays a huge role in games too, since a comfortable, accurate mouse will help you dominate while an unwieldy one will just lead to disaster. Not to overstate it, but from a gaming perspective choosing the right mouse is literally a matter of life or death.
Of course, any experienced gamer already knows how important being up to speed on the best gaming mice is to his or her success. But the problem is it can be difficult to evaluate the myriad options available and figure out which is the most comfortable or most accurate. Nevertheless, we've sampled some of the finest gaming mice available, and would like to offer you our picks for what we think are the best mice for Mac and PC. Note there are several sub-categories of mice - best mouse for MOBAs, wired and wireless mice options, and plenty more which we haven't covered yet, but we will in a future update. For now we're just looking at the best all-around mice for gaming, first person shooters, and daily drivers.

The Corsair M65 Pro RGB (See it on Amazon) is a specialized weapon designed specifically for right-handed, claw-grip gamers who play first person shooters. Out of all the mice we tested recently it was the most accurate and the most comfortable, which is really all that matters. We dig its aluminum body, which gives it a distinctly rigid feeling in your hand, and it also includes a custom weight system as well so you can tailor its heft to your liking. What really puts the M65 Pro RGB over the top though isn't its RGB lighting, which we don't really care about, but rather its Sniper button located in the thumb area. When depressed it lowers the mouse's DPI for more accurate tracking, letting us fire off a precise headshot then go back to run-and-gun in games like Battlefield 1. It's even available in white.

Not everyone grips their mouse with their fingertips. Some people like to lay their palm over the length of the mouse and let their fingers dance upon the buttons. For these folks we think the Razer Deathadder Chroma (See it on Amazon) is hands-down the best mouse because it's as comfortable as a velvet bathrobe and as accurate as a weather forecast in Siberia. Unlike a lot of high falutin mice with weights and customizable grips and more buttons than the Space Shuttle, the DeathAdder keeps it simple with just the basics; including buttons for left-and-right click, forward/back, and a mouse wheel. On paper, it doesn't sound like much really, but once we slid our palm over the contoured top and rested our fingers on its scooped buttons, we knew we had found the mouse of our dreams. Even better; the DeathAdder we reviewed was recently updated and is now called the DeathAdder Elite, adding DPI switching and a more precise sensor.
