See Every Shadowverse: Tempest of the Gods Card - IGN

The next Shadowverse expansion, Tempest of the Gods, is going to be out very very soon, and after several weeks of card reveals (including eight of our own), we now have the full set.
It's a genuinely exciting collection, offering up some powerful new takes on existing mechanics like Bloodcraft's Vengeance and Shadowcraft's Necromancy. It also takes several classes in new directions - Forestcraft is being given control tools, for instance, while Runecraft players are being tempted to build their decks around Earth Sigils. It's also worth pointing out that this is the first expansion where every class has been given two new Legendaries, and those cards are typically geared towards powerful effects that must be built around.
But hey, don't take my word for it. Check out the new cards yourselves in the slideshows below! (Each card's text is in the caption field, by the way. Apologies to users of IGN's iOS/Android apps - I believe there may be issues seeing the captions on those platforms.)
