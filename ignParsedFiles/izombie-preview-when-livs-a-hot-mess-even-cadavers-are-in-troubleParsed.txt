iZombie Preview: When Liv's a Hot Mess, Even Cadavers Are in Trouble - IGN

In each episode of iZombie, part of the fun is seeing what new brain Liv (Rose McIver) consumes, and what traits she takes on as a result. This week, Liv finds herself on "hot mess brain" and the results aren't pretty. A clubbing, self-obsessed, disorganized, scatter-brained wannabe DJ, the victim here is not exactly an upgrade for Liv.
Check out IGN's exclusive clip from "Some Like it Hot Mess," as Ravi (Rahul Kohl) learns just how much Liv's new persona is interfering with her job - and the corpses it involves.
Previewing this episode with IGN, iZombie co-creator/executive producer Rob Thomas said, "Rose, as she often does -- but this one I particularly enjoyed -- has so many winning, unscripted moments. Just looks that she gives that are so great. We kinda knew she would be good on this one."
