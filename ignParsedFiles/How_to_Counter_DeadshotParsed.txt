How to Counter Deadshot - Injustice 2 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains strategies and tips for fighting against Deadshot in Injustice 2. 
The deadly assassin has become a particularly frustrating opponent for some players, as they have great difficulty avoiding his many projectile attacks that are highly effective at both long and short range. 
As with most challenges in gaming, solving "the Deadshot problem" takes an even temper and patience above all else. 
Because you the button for blocking and retreating are one and the same, you aren't able to move towards Deadshot while trying to block his incoming attacks, unless you're using a character with an armored charge attack like Bane. 
To that end, you'll need to slowly advance across the play field, often very slowly, stopping to duck and block if Deadshot is spamming wrist cannon attacks. His response will likely be to dash backwards -- maybe throw in some trick shots, low rifle shots, or enhanced versions of any of his special moves -- but stay disciplined and keep inching forward until he eventually has nowhere to go. 
Once you manage to close the distance between you and your opponent, use your most powerful combo attacks to take down as much health as possible before they can counter the assault.
