Antique Coins - Resident Evil 7 Biohazard Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on how to find and collect the Antique Coins in Resident Evil 7 Biohazard. Antique Coins are used as a form of currency to unlock various items in the game, and finding Antique Coins can be difficult due to their small size and the places they are hidden in. There are 18 Coins to be found on Easy or Normal Difficulty in RE7, and 33 Coins in Madhouse Difficulty - many of which are moved to new locations 
Antique Coins can be traded in for items when you reach the Trailer in the Yard at the end of the Main House. Three birdcages hold three different items: 
Note that in RE7, after leaving the Dulvey Estate at the end of the Boathouse, any cages you have not unlocked will appear one final time at the Safe House at the entrance to the Salt Mines, giving you one last chance to collect rewards. 
 


Antique Coins are located in the following places - note that some of them can only be accessed in a short window, and once missed can never be recovered. 
There is an easily missed collectible that is only accessible if you do a very specific thing while controlling Clancy in the Derelict House Footage tape in the Guest House. As the tape begins, turn around and look on the ground to find a Lockpick. These are used to pick simple locks - like the one in the kitchen. When you enter the kitchen with the would-be ghost hunters, interact with the drawer and unlock it with the Lockpick.
