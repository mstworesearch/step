Power Cell Locations - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains the hidden Power Cell locations in Horizon Zero Dawn. 
 


Finding these items and completing the side quest Ancient Armory will unlock the powerful Shield Weaver armor, which renders Aloy nearly invincible for a time while wearing it. The power cells are presented below in the chronological order they can be obtained in during the main quest line. 
The first Power Cell can actually be found while exploring the open world after completing the prologue as Young Aloy. Return to the ruins where you found your Focus device and retrace your path through the barracks and down the stairs until you come to a closed door.
