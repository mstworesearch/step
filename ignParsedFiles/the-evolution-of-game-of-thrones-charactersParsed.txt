The Evolution of Game of Thrones Characters - IGN

With the countdown to Game of Thrones' seventh season underway (check out the first full trailer here), we should probably all take a look back at the savage and arduous journeys that the show's main characters have been through since the show premiered back in 2011.
We've watched the mighty fall, the weak get powerful, and children literally grow up before our eyes. Sellswords have become knights, pimps have risen to Lordships, and honored daughters have become rogue assassins. The Game of Thrones gallery is rife with change and many of these characters have endured torture and harsh horrors that worked to shape and mold them through the series.
Below you'll find a slideshow of the series' remaining (still living) main characters, spotlighting their looks through the years and giving you a glimpse at how much they've changed while trying to play the Game of Thrones. Just click right through the images to see the differences, and obviously spoilers for all the past seasons follow!
Game of Thrones' Season 7 premieres July 16th on HBO.
