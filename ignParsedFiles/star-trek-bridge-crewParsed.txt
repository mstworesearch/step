Big Story
Star Trek: Bridge Crew is a virtual reality simulation game that puts players aboard the starship Aegis in an adventure across the Star Trek universe. 
At E3 2016, during the Ubisoft Press Conference, there was a showcase for Star Trek: Bridge Crew which featured the likes of Levar Burton, Jeri Ryan and Karl Urban.  
 


Star Trek: Bridge Crew puts you on the bridge of the Aegis, a Federation ship that's exploring the galaxy. You, and your friends take the controls of various stations on the bridge, where you must give orders, steer the ship, fire your weapons and control your engines. Teamwork is the aim of the game, as no one person can do everyone's job.
