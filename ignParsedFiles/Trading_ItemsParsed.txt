Trading Items - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Trading Items provide another quest for Link. You don't have to participate, but if you do, you'll reap a powerful Sword upgrade which will make the rest of the game much easier. Although you can trade items as you go along, I suggest doing it all at once. 
1. CuccodexGet this from Dr. Left after you light his torch for him. 
2. Lon Lon EggGive the Cuccodex to Malon to the north of Horon Village. She'll give you the Lon Lon Egg. 
3. Ghastly DollRun into Maple with the Egg in your possession and she'll give you the Ghastly Doll. 
4. Iron PotTake the Ghastly Doll to the mayor's wife Mrs. Ruul. She will give you an Iron Pot. 
5. Lava SoupGo into the Chef's Kitchen in Subrosia. Give him the Iron Pot and he'll give you Lava Soup. 
6. Goron VaseGive the Lava Soup to Biggoron atop Goron Mountain in order to get the Goron Vase. 
7. FishGo to Sunken City and find Ingo's house. Show him the Goron Vase and he'll zonk you a Fish. 
8. MegaphoneTake the Fish to the area near Eyeglass Lake. Here, you'll meet an old man trying to get his cat out of the tree. Use the Fish to get the cat down and the man will give you a Megaphone. 
9. Mushroom Go to Mount Cucco and change the season to spring, then use the flower to get up to the high ledge. Go into the cave entrance and wake the sleeping guy inside with your Megaphone. This is Talon. He'll give you a Mushroom. 
10. Wooden BirdVisit Syrup. She'll see the Mushroom and complete her Potion. For your help, she'll hook you up with a Wooden Bird. 
11. Engine GreaseGo back to Horon Village and go to the clock shop. Give the Wooden Bird to the clockmaker, and he'll give you the Engine Grease. 
12. PhonographTake the Engine Grease to the Windmill. Go to the top of the mill and talk to the man here. He'll take your Grease and give you a Phonograph. Great trade! 
Final ItemOnce you have the Phonograph, go through the Tarm Ruins to the Lost Woods. Play the Phonograph for the music-loving Deku Scrub and he'll give you instructions on how to get the Noble Sword. Move to the stump to the left and change the season to Winter. Head west in the Winter, west in the Autumn, west in the Spring and west in the Summer. You'll end up at a secret location, where you'll receive the Noble Sword.
