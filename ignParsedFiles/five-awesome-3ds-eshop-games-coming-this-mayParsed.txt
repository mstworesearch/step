Five Awesome 3DS eShop Games Coming This May - IGN

The 3DS doesn't really need any more help being awesome these days - especially with Animal Crossing: New Leaf right around the corner. But even though many 3DS owners will be busy collecting fruit and playing mayor in a few weeks time, don't think that means you're doomed to an existence of anxious boredom in the meantime.
Below are five games coming to the 3DS eShop this month that are absolutely worth your attention. Mark your calendar and let the fun begin!

Kicking off the fun is Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, which hits the 3DS eShop on May 9 (check out our preview here). It's the latest entry in the Mario vs. DK series - albeit without the "vs." and with a whole different take on mini madness. It has four different modes, the main one challenging players to place different tiles using the touch screen to clear a path for toy Mario. It's a ton of fun, and a lot more challenging than you would think - definitely a breathe of fresh air for the series. There's also quite a bit to do, as Minis on the Move features 180 different puzzles, as well as supplementary mini-games and a level creator.

Next up is Mega Man 5, which is finally following in the footsteps of its fellow 8-bit predecessors by making its way to the 3DS Virtual Console on May 16. This NES classic has the Blue Bomber saving Dr. Light from the clutches of Protoman. More Mega Buster action is always a good thing, and you can't argue with an epic Mega vs. Protoman brawl, so definitely pick this one up if you're a fan of old school, 2D action. Again, Mega Man 1-4 are already available for download, and 6 is coming soon.

Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D will be available both in stores and on the eShop starting May 24. This is a 3D remake of the popular Wii game from Retro Studios. Not just a straight port, this version has some added features to round out the package and make it more portable-friendly, including an additional easy mode that gives the player more health and allows them to take more damage (don't worry - you can still play the "original mode" as well). There are also eight new levels found in a brand new world, which you unlock after beating the game, as well as new items and local multiplayer.

Two of the most underrated Zelda games are finally getting second life when GameBoy Color classics Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons hit the eShop on May 30. Co-developed by Nintendo and Capcom, the games are similar in style to GameBoy masterpiece Link's Awakening, and can be linked together via a password system that is implemented in a rather unique way and allows for some cool stuff... which I won't spoil for you. Any Zelda fan (or lover of awesome, topdown adventures) owes it to themselves to play these games.

Rounding out the list is The Denpa Men 2: Beyond the Waves, which is available for download on May 30 (check out our preview here). It's an unexpected sequel to quirky eShop RPG The Denpa Men: They Came By Wave, and is being touted as an expanded and more refined version of the original concept. This game may not have the likes of Mario, Link or Donkey Kong to help its cause and grab your attention, but if it's anything like the original, it will be a surprisingly delightful experience well worth the download.
