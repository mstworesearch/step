Impa - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story

Impa is a recurring character in The Legend of Zelda and appears in this game as well. Impa is princess Zelda's nurse and is sent by her to get Din, in Holodrum, and to bring her back with her to Hyrule. To do this she becomes the cook for Din's group of performers. 
When Onox captures Din she tells Link to save Holodrum and restore the seasons. She also tells Link to go and visit the Maku Tree. From this point onwards you can find her in a tree just north of Horon Village. 
Impa, like the Maku Tree, is very useful because she'll give you hints on where the next dungeon is. Furthermore they're usually much more straightforward than the Maku Tree's. So if you're stuck you can go and find Impa.
