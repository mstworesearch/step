Everything You Need to Know About the Zelda: Oracle Games - IGN

Capcom and Nintendo's Game Boy Color Zelda adventures have finally hit the 3DS eShop today. Oracle of the Ages and Oracle of the Seasons are both fantastic games in their own rights. If you don't believe me, check out the reviews -- both Ages and Seasons received the rare perfect 10 from IGN back in the day.
Now that we all have a chance to revisit these two portable classics via their release on the 3DS eShop, there's a good chance you'll need a bit of help along the way. Lucky for you, we have a pair of fantastic wikis that will teach you to master the weather in Oracle of Seasons, and help you control time in Oracle of Ages.
As you might know, Capcom's portable Zelda games were initially conceived as a trilogy of adventures dubbed the "Triforce Series." Originally called Mystical Seed trilogy, the three games were intended to communicate with one another and each be part of a single, larger experience. Eventually the trilogy was pared down to two of games, with hints of the third game scattered throughout Ages and Seasons.
Whether you're playing through these adventures for the first time, or revisiting them again a decade later, you owe it to yourself to grab these off the eShop.
