Memories - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a new type of collectible are Memories that Link can obtain in his journeys. After speaking to Purah in Hateno Town during the Locked Mementos Quest, you'll learn from Impa that Princess Zelda took several pictures in the Sheikah Slate, and each location is tied to your memories of her. Finding each location is necessary in order to complete the (completely optional) Captured Memories main quest.
