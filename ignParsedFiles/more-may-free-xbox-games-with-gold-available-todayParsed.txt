May Free Xbox Games With Gold Announced - IGN

May's line-up of free Xbox One and Xbox 360 games for Gold subscribers has been announced.
The full lineup, plus when they'll be available, is:
Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a surprisingly challenging 2D puzzle-platformer, while Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is an isometric shooter spin-off we gave an 8.1 and said is "almost as essential as Lara's third-person excursions."
360 gets a Star Wars-themed month, perhaps to coincide with the recent Last Jedi trailer and Battlefront 2 reveal. The Force Unleashed 2 was, by our reckoning, "fails to tell an interesting yarn, but also somehow manages to make the cool combat mechanics feel relatively pedestrian".
Luckily, Lego Star Wars is a better proposition - we gave it an 8.0, saying "if you've waited until now to try Lego Star Wars, this is definitely the game to buy".
As always, both 360 games will be available to play on Xbox One via backward compatibility, and April Game with Gold, The Walking Dead: Season 2 will still be available on Xbox One until May 15.
