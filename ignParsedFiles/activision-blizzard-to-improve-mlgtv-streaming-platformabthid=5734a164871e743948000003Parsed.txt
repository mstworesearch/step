Activision Blizzard to Improve MLG.tv Streaming Platform - IGN

Activision Blizzard Media Networks has announced the launch of "new content, broadcast experiences and distribution partnerships" for the MLG.tv streaming platform.
Activision Blizzard confirmed the acquisition of eSports organization Major League Gaming back in January. Chairman of Activision Blizzard Media Networks Steve Bornstein said today: "We're building a network dedicated to the thrill of competition and the passion of the fans."
MLG.tv showed off its new "Enhanced Viewing Experience" (EVE) at the IAB Digital Content NewFronts today, which has a built-in system that shows match statistics, leaderboards, and insights based on what the viewer is watching.
In addition, former pro gamer Chris Puckett has been unveiled as the new host of a daily ESR broadcast, which will show premium highlights, interviews, and news segments.
This new content will be launched during the MLG Anaheim Open, a Call of Duty: Black Ops III tournament starting on June 10. The event will also see a deeper collaboration with Facebook to share a number of new formats and programming to a wider audience.
In other eSports news, a large announcement is coming from ESL tomorrow. Also, did you know IGN is teaming up with SiriusXM for a brand new eSports show?
