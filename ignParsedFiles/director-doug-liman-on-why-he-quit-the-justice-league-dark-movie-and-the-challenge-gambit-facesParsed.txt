Director Doug Liman on Why He Quit the Justice League Dark Movie and the Challenge Gambit Faces - IGN

I chatted with Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman today about his upcoming true crime movie American Made (look for that interview next week), during which time I also asked him about two high-profile comic book movies he's dropped out of directing: Justice League Dark (aka Dark Universe) and Gambit.
Liman had been talking up Justice League Dark as recently as last month before the news broke that he had parted ways with the project. In that case, Liman's plate was simply too full to end up accommodating the DC Comics adaptation.
