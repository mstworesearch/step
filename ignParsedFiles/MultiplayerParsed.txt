Multiplayer - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Mass Effect: Andromeda's main multiplayer is a wave-based team shooter that features various objectives and three enemy types. Selecting Quick Match and choosing your difficulty (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Random) will put you in a match with others on one of five maps against the kett, Remnant, or outlaws. Your team is then challenged to survive seven waves of various missions. 
Below you'll find tips for the multiplayer along with catalogued information of the store and character options. Scroll to the bottom of the page for information on how to earn free mission funds. 
 


Make sure to customize your loadout. For faster recharge times on your abilities you can select lighter weapons like a pistol / assault rifle combo. The base Avenger / Predator will give you a 100% recharge speed, but a sniper rifle like the viper and the predator pistol for example will give you a 25% penalty meaning you can use your abilities less often. 
When your character levels up don't neglect passive skills. These are the last two abilities in the menu, and while they're not as flashy as the other skills, they'll help you survive longer and be more proficient in combat. 
Add mods if you have them! Your mods are account wide so you can apply them to each of your weapons if they're available.
