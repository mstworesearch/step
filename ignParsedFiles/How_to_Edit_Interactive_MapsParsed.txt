How to Edit Interactive Maps - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Anyone can contribute to the Interactive Maps! Here's how to add your very own map points to the map and link them to pages in the wiki. 
Right-click on the spot where you want to add a map marker. The marker will appear precisely where you clicked on it -- so zoom in really close and click in the right place! You won't be able to move a marker once you save it, but a moderator can. Let a moderator know if you want a marker moved by flagging a page in the wiki (hit FLAG PAGE in the upper left corner and tell us about the mistake). 
After adding your map marker, you'll need to add some information about the marker and link it to an appropriate wiki page (or another map). 
First, add the title, or the name of the page. It's ideal for the marker's title to match the page in the wiki. 
Secondly, you may search for a wiki page to link the map marker to. If the marker marks a collectible location, link to the "index page" for that collectible type (e.g., "Heart Pieces," "Red Coins", "Templar Flags", "Hidden Packages", etc.).
