What the heck is a wiki?

Our attempt to answer issues which most commonly occur on IGN's wikis.
            




                                                Endless Space 2 is a turn-based, 4X space-strategy game that launches players into the role of the leader of one of the many intelligent beings of the Endless universe at the beginning of the space colonization age. This sequel will elevate the genre with a finely balanced mix of character-deep factions with their own stories, a senate for political intrigue, a new battle plan system for strategic confrontations, new streamlined interfaces with Amplified Reality, and much more!
