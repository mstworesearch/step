Memory 1 - Subdued Ceremony - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Memory 1 - Subdued Ceremony is one of 19 unlockable Memories in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
In order to find and view Memories, you must search for the locations based on the visual clues in your Sheikah Slate Album. Upon arriving at the correct destination, you'll find a glowing spot that will trigger the memory, unlocking it for you. 
The photo in question shows a location in Central Hyrule not far from Hyrule Castle itself. In fact, the location is just South of the castle, located in the spot known as the Sacred Ground Ruins, where a small pool of water surrounds a dais now patrolled by a Guardian. So long as you are quick and quiet, you should be able to reach the site of the memory in the center to trigger the flashback.
