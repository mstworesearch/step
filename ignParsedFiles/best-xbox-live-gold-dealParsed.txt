The Best Xbox Live Gold Deal - IGN

Microsoft's Xbox Live Gold for Xbox One and Xbox 360 is a continuation of the same service started nearly 15 years ago on the original Xbox. Sony wouldn't introduce its PlayStation Network until 4 years later, making Xbox Live the oldest of the continuously running console services.
Between its online play and free monthly games, Gold is a hugely valuable service, and if you commit to a 12-month membership, there are always deals to be had. If you're still not on-board, even after all this time, here's why you need Xbox Live in your life.

If you want to play online multiplayer, you absolutely need Xbox Live Gold. It's a requirement. All that server infrastructure doesn't come cheap, and Microsoft's paid service is the only way to play online games. You'll miss out on the latest wave of multiplayer-only games like our 2016 Game of the Year Overwatch, FFXIV, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty, Titanfall 2, and more.

On top of the multiplayer accessibility, an Xbox Live Gold subscription entitles you to free games for both the Xbox One and Xbox 360 every month (see them at Xbox.com). As a bonus, the Xbox 360 games given out each month are part of the Xbox Backwards Compatibility program, meaning you don't need to dust off your Xbox 360 to enjoy them; you can simply play them on your Xbox One.
Microsoft also offers Deals With Gold, giving subscribers discounts on full games, DLC, in-game currency packs, and a lot more (see them at Xbox.com). Basically if it's sold on the marketplace, it might show up in Deals With Gold. If you buy your games digitally, or even if you pick up DLC on the regular, the savings difference will recoup the cost of your sub.

The amount of time you want to subscribe to Xbox Live is pretty flexible. The official paid subscriptions come in three different lengths: one, three, and 12-month. If you're looking to maximize your savings, the 12-month subscription is always going to be the best deal. If you want to test the waters and haven't had a shot at a free promotional trial, drop a few bucks on a one-month subscription and feel things out. Any commitment to Xbox Live entitles you to all its benefits during the subscription period.
