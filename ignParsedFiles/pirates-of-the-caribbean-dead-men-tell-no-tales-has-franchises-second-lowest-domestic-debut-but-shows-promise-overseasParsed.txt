Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Has Franchise's Second-Lowest Domestic Debut, But Shows Promise Overseas - IGN

While Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales topped the box office in its domestic debut, its estimated three-day weekend earnings of $62.2 million make it the second-lowest debut in the history of the franchise.
The film is projected to make approximately $76 million over the four-day weekend, which includes estimated earnings up through Memorial Day. While the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's performance has been waning domestically, the series has grown in popularity overseas. In fact, the series' fourth entry, On Stranger Tides, is the franchise's highest-grossing installment internationally with $804.6 million, despite it being the first Pirates film that failed to crack $300 million domestically.
As such, it stands to reason that Dead Men Tell No Tales could end up recouping its $230 million production budget (not including marketing costs) and end up being a hit for Disney, so long as the film performs well enough internationally. So far, the film has made an estimated $208.3 million abroad, which makes it the twelfth biggest opening overseas ever, but still trailing behind both On Stranger Tides and At World's End, which debuted to a whopping $260.4 million and $216 million, respectively. Dead Men Tell No Tales' worldwide opening three-day weekend total stands at an estimated $270.6 million.
