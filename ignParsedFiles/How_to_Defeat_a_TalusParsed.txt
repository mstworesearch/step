How to Defeat a Talus - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Stone Talus are slow moving, but hit hard. On their backs is a dark stone, which is their weak point. Running around the Stone Talus can be effective, since it moves so slow. Watch for its swinging arms though if you decide to run close. You can use a bomb to temporarily destroy its arms and knock it over. This gives you an opening to climb on its back and hit its weak point. 

Some Stone Taluses must be climbed to reach their weak point. Others can be struck from the ground.
