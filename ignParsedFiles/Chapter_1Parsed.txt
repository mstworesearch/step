Chapter 1 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The chapter will begin with a cutscene with the narrator before shifting focus to the Mishima Zaibatsu. Here, Nina is directing the organization, while Heihachi arrives on the scene to infiltrate the area. After some more plot exposition, you'll gain control of Heihachi and will have to fight the Tekken Force soldiers. 
The fight here is simple, you'll just have to defeat each of the soldiers that attack you. The Tekken Force isn't that strong compared to you, but can deal damage if you let them. Each soldier will go down rather quickly with a few hits. Keep doing this until all of the soldiers are defeated an another cutscene is triggered. 
The next portion of the fight will have you facing off against Nina Williams. This acts like a traditional Tekken battle, but with a few stipulations. You need to defeat Nina twice, with the second time refilling her health and triggering Rage Mode. Other than this, the match will play out the exact same.  
Use your skills to attack Nina and bring her health down both times. This isn't a hard fight, so you shouldn't have too much trouble facing her. Once Nina is defeated, a cutscene will trigger and play out till the end of the chapter.
