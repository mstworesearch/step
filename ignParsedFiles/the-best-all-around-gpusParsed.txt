The Best All-Around Graphics Cards - IGN

Last updated: March 21, 2017.
When we're old and sitting in our rocking chairs on the porch we'll look back fondly on the year 2016, wipe a tear from our eye, and regale our grandkids about the move to 14nm and 16nm FinFET GPUs. "Your granddad had 100fps at 1440p," we'll tell our grandkids as they ignore us while ensconced in their 32k VR simulations. They won't understand, of course, how amazing the year 2016 was in terms of GPU advancements, but it can't be understated. Not only did we finally move from 28nm planar transistors all the way down to 14/16nm 3D FinFET, but the accompanying performance boost from one generation to the next was one of the largest ever recorded in modern times. Instead of the typical 10 to 20 percent boosts we experience going from one generation of silicon to the next, we saw a 60 to 80 percent boost. Frame rates skyrocketed, 4k gaming became viable with a single GPU, and laptops were able to sport desktop-class graphics for the first time due to improvements in efficiency as well. It was (and still is) a great time to be alive, indeed.
Despite 2016's general awesomeness, 2017 will be even better because we'll finally see AMD challenge Nvidia's supremacy at the high end of the market with its upcoming Vega GPU. In 2016 AMD only attacked the mid-range with the RX 480, 470, and 460 while Nvidia launched (at first) into the high-end with its GTX 1080 and 1070 GPUs, and for a finishing move it dropped the almighty GTX 1080 Ti. This imbalance will be rectified soon with Vega, which should launch by June and will compete directly with Nvidia's flagship consumer GPUs.
Until Vega launches, things will be a bit static in the GPU department, so we wanted to share our picks for the best GPUs currently available.
