Upgradable Weapons - Final Fantasy XV Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In Final Fantasy XV, Noctis can find a variety of rare but potentially powerful Upgradable Weapons throughout the land of Eos. While mildly powerful on their own, these weapons can be given to Cid the Mechanic, an in exchange for certain Treasures, they can be upgraded to become even more powerful in combat - sometimes several times! Many times, upgrading a weapon may take time to prepare, requiring Noctis to go on a different quest or bounty hunt to pass the time. 


See below for a list of weapons, where to find them, and how they can be upgraded.
