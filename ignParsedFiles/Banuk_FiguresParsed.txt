Banuk Figures - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Banuk Figures are very rare Collectibles scattered around the map. Like many others, you can purchase a map from certain vendors to get a general idea of where they are. 
Below are directions of where to find these relics, as well as the text that accompanies each Banuk Relic. 
This Banuk Figure is found north-east of the Devil's Thirst Bandit Camp. 
When you get to the base of the mountain, you'll see various paintings on the rock. They will show you where to roughly climb, so follow them to the top and you'll soon have your item.
