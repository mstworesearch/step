Settling Worlds - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page explains how to establish new Outposts on and increase the viability of the many worlds that Ryder visits in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Reaching 100% Viability on a planet unlocks the Terraformer Trophy / Achievement, while reaching it on all planets will unlock All Clear. 
Building a new colony for Milky Way settlers in the Heleus Cluster is no easy feat, especially when many of the planets that had originally been designated as "Golden Worlds" are no longer ideal environments to sustain life. 
Due to the surprisingly inhospitable climates found on the various planets that the Andromeda Initiative had hoped to colonize, new outposts must be established elsewhere. 
A planet's Viability Rating determines how suitable it is for settlement by Initiative colonists. Ryder raises this rating incrementally by completing various activities on each world. Complete these to raise the planet's Viability Rating to 100%.
