How to Get the Master Sword - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Master Sword is not easy to come by in Breath of the Wild. No main story point will ever directly lead you to it - and in fact you can complete the game without ever finding it. The Master Sword does not break, but must recharge after use. The Master Sword cannot be thrown -- it instead fires an energy projectile, or beam attack, but only if you have full hearts.
