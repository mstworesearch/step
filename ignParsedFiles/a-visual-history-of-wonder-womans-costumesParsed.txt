A Visual History of Wonder Woman's Costumes - IGN

Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic heroes in comics, and it doesn't hurt that she also has one of the most distinctive superhero costumes. But even so, her look has evolved quite a bit over the years as she's made the jump from comics to TV to film and her general role within the DCU has evolved.
With Gal Gadot's Diana Prince taking the spotlight in the new Wonder Woman movie (don't forget to check out our review of the Wonder Woman movie), we thought it would be fun to break down the evolution of Wonder Woman's costume, ranging from her Golden Age debut to her most recent adventures. Click right on the gallery below to see for yourself.
Also look for DC's current Wonder Woman comic to be gaining a new creative team this summer as writer Greg Rucka and artist Liam Sharp wrap up their run and pass the torch to Shea Fontana and Mirka Andolfo.
Let us know which of these Wonder Woman looks is your favorite in the comments below.
