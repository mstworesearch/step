Fifty Shades of Grey Enjoys Huge Debut at Weekend Box Office - IGN

There was no safe word rival movies could use to stop Fifty Shades of Grey from whipping their butts this weekend, both at home and abroad.
The highly-anticipated adaptation of the erotic bestseller dominated the domestic box office with an estimated $81.7 million, and grossed a staggering $158 million overseas, the biggest international opening of 2015 so far and the biggest R-rated opening ever internationally.
The Universal-Focus movie, reportedly budgeted at $40 million, currently has a worldwide cume of $239.7 million.
Fifty Shades' domestic haul makes it the biggest Valentine's Day weekend opening ever, and the second highest-grossing February release behind The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million).
Kingsman: The Secret Service, Fox's adaptation of the Mark Millar comic book, opened in second place with an estimated $35.6 million. That's director Matthew Vaughn's second biggest domestic opening behind X-Men: First Class ($55.1 million). The movie, which has already been playing abroad, has a worldwide total of $79.4 million.
Meanwhile in limited release, the vampire satire What We Do in the Shadows opened in L.A. and New York City this weekend with a strong $65,830.
