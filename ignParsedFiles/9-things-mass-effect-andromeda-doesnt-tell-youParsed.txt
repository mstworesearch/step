Things Mass Effect: Andromeda Doesn't Tell You - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Mass Effect: Andromeda features many menus and systems. Some of those have their own secrets. Use these tools and tricks for a smoother exploration and combat experience and get more information about your Ryder in Andromeda. 
Consumables exist! Equip up to four in your loadout (you get two slots when you start) and use them in the weapons menu. Consumables include things like incendiary ammo, cryo ammo, and shield capacitors. 
Ryder can buy and discover consumables in containers. Enemies occasinally drop them as well. 
Save a set of skills and your chosen profile in the Favorites wheel to easily swap between multiple skills. Save a favorite skills loadout in the Skills and Profile menus. The button that pulls up the Favorites menu is listed on the bottom right corner of that menu. You can access the Favorites in the weapons and consumables quick menu. Check out your controls settings to find out which button that is for you. 
This is never explained in a pop-up tutorial, but Ryder is able to quick-cycle through their equipped weapons while in combat, instead of constantly having to use the weapon menu. 
Just hold down X on XB1 or Square on PS4 to switch to your next weapon.
