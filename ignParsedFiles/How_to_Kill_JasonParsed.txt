How to Kill Jason - Friday the 13th: The Video Game Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Yes, you can kill Jason in Friday the 13th: The Game. Although you can win matches in many other ways, killing Jason once and for all is an in-depth Easter egg similar to the Call of Duty Zombies map Easter eggs. 
 


The process to complete this may be simple, but remember that doing all these steps will require a lot of coordination with your allies in the match. 
Remember that the Tommy steps can be done at any point, so don't worry about someone having to die until you are getting near the end. The final steps need to all happen very quickly, any hesitation can result in the stun wearing off and the sweater being wasted.
