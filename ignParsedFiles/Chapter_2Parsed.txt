Chapter 2 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
After the cutscene at the beginning, you'll watch a scene from an event that happened during Tekken 4. This was when Kazuya and Heihachi had to fight off a group of Jack units that were storming the temple the two of them were at after fighting against Jin during the events of Tekken 3. Heihachi and Kazuya must team up against the Jack units as they attack. 
During the first part of this battle, you'll control Kazuya and will need to defeat a number of Jack-4 Units. The Jack units are very similar to the Tekken Force soldiers from the previous chapters. However, this time the Jack units will deal more damage when they hit and are slower moving. Take down each Jack-4 as they appear, when the fighting starts however you'll have to block immediately. Each Jack will enter the area with an attack that you will get hit by if you aren't careful. 
You'll take down about 5 Jack-4 units before the scene continues onward. After a short part of the cutscene, you'll gain control of Heihachi for the remainder of the battle. You'll then face another group of Jack-4 units that will atatck you in the same way as they did when you controlled Kazuya. 
Fight off the Jack units the same way you did before. Once you take down the last Jack-4, the cutscene will trigger and play out to the end of the chapter.
