New to Netflix for June 2017 - IGN

Netflix in June features the return of Orange is the New Black - which looks like it might be getting even darker now that Emmy rules prohibit it from getting a nomination as a "Comedy" now.
And speaking of Orange, that show's creator, Jenji Kohan, has executive produced a new Netflix series called GLOW - about the cult '80s women's wrestling series, starring Alison Brie and Ellen Wong. That's also on the slate for June.
You'll also get to see, thanks to that CW/Netflix deal, new seasons of Arrow and The 100 (and presumedly The Flash too) as they'll arrive shortly after the season finale dust settles. There's also Zodiac, Full Metal Jacket, My Left Foot, The Sixth Sense, and Netflix Originals like The Ranch and Flaked.
Also, thanks to Disney's deal with Netflix, the House of Mouse's movies show up on Netflix a lot sooner these days. Hence, being able to catch Moana mid-June, just six months after it opened in theaters.
Check out the gallery below for our spotlight on some of the most notable debuts of the month, followed by the full list below.
