Chapter 4 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The beginning of the chapter gives a background on the legacy of the Mishima Clan. Another cutscene will play afterwards and lead into a new location and new character to play as. Eventually you'll be put in control of Lars and will need to fight off the Mishima Zaibatsu soldiers. The fight starts with you holding a gun in third person. Use the button prompts to fire the assault rifle and attack the soldiers. 
If you are hit while holding the assault rifle, you'll immediately revert back to noral status and will have to fight the soldiers head-on. You can always pull back out the gun with the input shown on the screen, but if you find it difficult to aim with the gun then just fight the soldiers normally. The soldiers don't have a lot of health, but will attack viciously by mixing up their physical and ranged gun attacks. 
Once all the soldiers are defeated, another cutscene will play towards the end of the chapter.
