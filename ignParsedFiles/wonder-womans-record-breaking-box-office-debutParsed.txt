Wonder Woman's Record-Breaking Box Office Debut - IGN

Wonder Woman debuted in first place at the domestic box office, breaking the record for the biggest opening weekend of all time for a female director.
Director Patty Jenkins' new DC movie earned an estimated $100.5 million domestically, eclipsing Fifty Shades of Grey, the prior record holder for the biggest debut for a female director, which grossed just over $85 million when it opened in 2015.
When compared to other superhero solo films, Wonder Woman's debut is bigger than both Iron Man and Doctor Strange, but behind the likes of Man of Steel, Deadpool and Spider-Man.
