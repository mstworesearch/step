McDonald's Introduces the Frork, a Fork With Fries For Prongs - IGN

Biting down on your fork never tasted so good. Or good at all. Generally speaking, it's mildly to moderately uncomfortable to bite down on your fork, but fast food restaurant McDonald's has found a solution.
Instead of cold, hard metal, or cold, somewhat less-hard, plastic, McDonald's has replaced the prongs of the traditional fork with hot, salty french fries, and called the mash-up a Frork.
Its new Frork is the sort of disruptive technology normally reserved for bloated Silicon Valley tech start-ups. Instead of seeking seed capital from angel investors, McDonald's new Frork instead seeks flavor drippings from the fast food maker's new line of Signature Crafted Recipes.
In a mock infomercial for the new Frork, we're shown its many uses in sopping up the sauces on McDonald's newest line of hamburgers, including Pico Guacamole, Sweet BBQ Bacon and Maple Bacon Dijon. All that flavor goo is bound to escape the confines of the bun in the course of consumption, and rather than let it sit there, unconsumed, on your plate, the Frork helps your dab up every last bit of it.
Ultimately, though, it's just a funny little piece of McDonald-land you can add to your collection, right next to the Super Mario McDonald's Happy Meal toys out right now. You can get your own Frork when McDonald's launches its new sandwich line May 5, or you can call the 800-number in the infomercial to land yourself a Frork or a free coupon to try one of its Signature Crafted Recipes.
If you do manage to score one, let's us know you've been Frorked in the comments.
