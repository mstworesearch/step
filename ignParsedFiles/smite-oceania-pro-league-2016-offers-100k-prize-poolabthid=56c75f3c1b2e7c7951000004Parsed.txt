Smite Oceania Pro League 2016 Offers $100K Prize Pool - IGN

Hi-Rez Studios continues to expand support for the pro level of Smite in the Oceanic region for season three of its eSports competition.
How much extra support? Try $100,000AUD in the prize pool this year for professional teams from Australia and New Zealand.
This $100K prize pool tops Hi-Rez's previous highest prize pool offering of $65,000AUD in 2015, of which Smite Oceania Pro League victors Avant Garde took home the lion's share.
"Since introducing the Smite Pro League to the Oceania region last season [season two], we've been very excited to see the growth in quality and competitiveness of the scene," said Hi-Rez Studios' eSports manager Adam Mierzejewski. "We think the Oceania scene will compete very strongly on the world stage in Season 3.
"With over 14 million players worldwide, Smite continues to grow, and Oceania has been an important piece of the game's success. Our goal is to create a sustainable eSports ecosystem for Smite in Oceania that can last for years to come."
The $100,000 prize pool will be split among six Pro League teams and across three events, with the bulk of the winnings set aside for the CGPL Autumn LAN finals on April 16 and 17.
The Oceanic region will be competing across three "Splits", with Split One kicking off on February 27.
Avant Garde and Dire Wolves, runners-up in the 2015 final, receive automatic seeding, and will be competing against the top two teams from two qualifying stages.
