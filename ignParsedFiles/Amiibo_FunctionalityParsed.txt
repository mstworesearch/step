Video: What Every Amiibo Does
Players can use a variety of both Legend of Zelda themed Amiibo and non-Zelda Amiibo to scan in to perform a variety of features depending on the particular Amiibo. 
Amiibo can be scanned in using the Sheikah Slate, much like other Runes. Note that by default, the Amiibo Rune is not active and listed on your Runes - you must turn the ability on in the options menu. 
Amiibo can be scanned once a day - but before you scan one, read about this exploit. 
Because the rewards are randomly generated each time you scan an Amiibo, it's very easy to take advantage of. 
Right before scanning an Amiibo, save the game. If you don't like what's inside the chest, simply reload the save and scan the Amiibo again. Repeat until you have the items you want! 
See a list of every Amiibo's function below. 
Zelda-themed Amiibos will summon special chests, some with exclusive equipment, plus a different variety of items that drop outside of the chest sometimes within barrels and crates. Most weapons will not appear in these chests until the Paraglider is received. 
Others will not appear until after the Main Quest, Free the Divine Beasts, have been completed. These special, rare items are noted with an *asterisk. 
The chart below lists what every Zelda Amiibo does. 
 
Virtually all Amiibo not affiliated with The Legend of Zelda can also be used to summon a supply drop of ingredients, but the ingredients are always a random assortment anywhere from three to six - but does not include a chest. 
These Amiibo can be scanned once per day.
