Riot Games Drops 'Warsongs,' an EDM Album Inspired by League of Legends - IGN

Many games have their own soundtracks, but Riot Games released something different today: an album to capture the sound of the competitive, eSports side of League of Legends.
Titled "Warsongs," the album is a collaboration of many popular electronic dance music (EDM) artists, including Arty, MitiS, Marshmello, James Egbert, Mako, Hyper Potions, Jauz, Minnesota, and Vicetone. According to a making-of the album on Riot's site, the Riot music team wanted it to be "an album that could serve as the soundtrack to the 2016 ranked season."
Warsongs is currently available to listen to and download for free on Riot's website, as well as YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud.
The 2016 League Championship Series season kicks off today, with the first match of the Spring Split a rematch of last year's EU LCS Summer Playoff Grand Finals: Fnatic vs. Origen. You can follow the action on Riot Games' Twitch channel.
Riot Games also recently announced Jhin, the newest champion to join the roster of League of Legends as part of Patch 6.1.
