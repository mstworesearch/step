Geoff Johns Continues DC Rebirth Saga in 'Doomsday Clock' - IGN

DC's Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns is returning to comics later this year to continue the work he started with DC Universe Rebirth #1. Johns, artist Gary Frank and colorist Brad Anderson will chronicle the long-awaited meeting between Superman and Watchmen's Doctor Manhattan in a mini-series entitled Doomsday Clock.
Doomsday Clock was first revealed by Syfy Wire. The mini-series appears to serve as the endgame of the current DC Rebirth status quo, building directly on the events of both DC Universe Rebirth #1 and the Batman/Flash crossover "The Button" (which is set to wrap up in The Flash #22 on May 17). The series will explore the fallout when the DC and Watcmen universes collide, as Superman's innate sense of hope and optimism clash with Manhattan's cynical attempts to experiment with the fabric of the DCU.
