World of Final Fantasy Review - IGN

For the past several years, Square Enix has released a landslide of Final Fantasy spin-offs with varying success: toe-tapping rhythm adventures, adrenaline-fueled fighters, and some forgettable mobile titles. Adding to the list is the cute-as-can-be World of Final Fantasy, a warm and fuzzy blend of nostalgic turn-based combat and monster stacking that had me alternately squealing with delight and sighing with boredom throughout the more than 60-hour campaign.
