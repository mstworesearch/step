The Legend of Zelda Symphony Concert Series Kicks Off This October - IGN

At Nintendo's E3 2011 press conference last month, the company announced plans to celebrate The Legend of Zelda's 25th anniversary with a special symphony concert series. Today more details were revealed, including that the first concert will be held at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles on October 21 of this year, followed by a full tour in 2012.
"The Legend of Zelda has few peers in the pantheon of video game giants, and the games and their music have always shared a deep connection," said Scott Moffitt, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of Sales & Marketing. "Through these concerts, fans nationwide will be able to gather and show their love for the quarter century of action, adventure and excitement that The Legend of Zelda games have brought to their lives."
The Zelda songs that will be included in the concert were hand-picked by legendary video game composer Koji Kondo himself, best known for his scores for The Legend of Zelda and Mario series. A 70-piece orchestra, joined by full choir, will perform new arrangements of these classic tunes. The concerts will be produced by Jason Michael Paul Productions, the producers of PLAY! A Video Game Symphony.
"The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert Tour brings one of the video game industry's most exciting and enduring franchises to the concert hall and presents what we feel is the definitive concert experience for the series," said executive producer Jason Michael Paul. "It's an event that fans and music aficionados won't want to miss."
