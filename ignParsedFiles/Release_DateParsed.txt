Release Date - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
At E3 2014, Nintendo announced The Legend of Zelda for Wii U would be released in 2015. No further details have been given. [1] 
However, Aonuma stated on Miiverse that the game will be playable at E3 2015, so it seems likely for the game to be released after that event.[2]
