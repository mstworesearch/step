Trove Review - IGN

Trove is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game created with the same brightly colored voxels that define Minecraft, and it's an appropriate choice for what it is. Much like the buildings, landscapes, and even characters formed with these blocks, it lacks clear focus, especially when compared to its genre peers. Somehow it manages to exude a degree of flawed appeal even with these shortcomings, although I've found that its pleasures leave the best impressions in small doses.
You can dig through these voxels all you want with a mining laser, but no matter how deep you dig you'd be hard pressed to find a story lurking underneath. Trove kicks off with a cutscene discussing some sort of spat between the sun and the moon, but it drops the concept almost immediately. Roleplay suffers as bit as a result, particularly if you're like me and enjoy having some kind of reason for slaying thousands upon thousands of foes.
No, Trove is more interested in loot than storytelling. Endless, nearly unmanageable loot. It seems to think of itself as an MMORPG with Minecraft trappings, but in structure, it owes far greater debts to Diablo 3's Adventure Mode than World of Warcraft. Seconds after the throwaway cutscene it casts you into a hub that becomes your eternal starting point for every login, and from there it's all about leaping through portals into procedurally generated zones peppered with dungeons and bosses ready to scatter loot.
