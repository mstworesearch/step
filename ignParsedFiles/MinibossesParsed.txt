Minibosses - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Minibosses are tough monsters in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild who appear at specific locations in the giant map of Hyrule. You'll know you're fighting a Miniboss when the name of the boss appears at the top of the screen, along with its health meter. Plus, each boss gets its own music and appears in various locations and forms throughout Hyrule. 
This massive monster swims beneath the desert's sand. It spends most of its time submerged, but if it senses sound, it will breach the surface to feast on whatever it can grab.
