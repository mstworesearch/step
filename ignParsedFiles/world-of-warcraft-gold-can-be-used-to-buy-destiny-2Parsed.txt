World of Warcraft Gold Can Be Used to Buy Destiny 2 - IGN

Activision has announced that Destiny 2 will be available on PC exclusively from the Blizzard Launcher, which likely means you'll be able to buy it using World of Warcraft Tokens.
Back in February, the rules were changed on WoW Tokens, which could only previously be redeemed using in-game gold for extra subscription time. Now they can be used in exchange for Blizzard Launcher (formerly the Battle.net app) credit.
According to Kotaku, the price of WoW Tokens has spiked since the reveal of Destiny 2 and the announcement that it would be available through Blizzard's store on PC. Currently, people are using any in-game gold they don't need to buy things like Hearthstone card packs and Overwatch loot boxes.
The Tokens reached as expensive as 140,000 gold on the in-game Auction House at one point, before falling back down to around 120,000 gold. To buy with real money, the Tokens cost $20.
If you're short on cash, but great at grinding WoW gold, it looks like you've got your own way of grabbing Destiny 2 when it comes out. It's currently due for a September 8 release on console, however the PC version may be coming later.
