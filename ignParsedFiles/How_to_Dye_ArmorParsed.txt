How to Dye Armor - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link now has the ability to dye certain pieces of Armor that you'll find across Hyrule. 

There's a specialty dye shop located only in Hateno Village, in the far West Necluda area of Hyrule. Once there, look for the large building with colored vials - the Kochi Dye Shop - and speak to the man, Sayge, inside. For 20 Rupees, you can dye all of the armor you are currently wearing - plus five ingredients that match the color you desire. These ingredients can be mixed and match from the available colors - so long as you hold five in total. 
Note that certain pieces of armor, like the Old Shirt, Well-Worn Trousers, Champion's Tunic, and any jewelry or Amiibo armor cannot be dyed. You can also unequip certain armor pieces if you only want to dye just the Head Armor or certain parts. You can also ask to revert your dyed clothing to it's original color. 
Below you'll find a list of every color you can dye your armor - and the known ingredients you can use for that color type.
