Final Fantasy 9 Announced for PC and Mobile in Japan - IGN

Final Fantasy IX will be making its way to PC and smartphones in Japan, Square Enix has announced.
According to the publisher's official announcement, the beloved Japanese role-playing game, which first launched on the original PlayStation back in 2000, will available on PC, iOS and Android "soon."
There's no word on when or if the game will be getting similar treatment in the west. That said, Square Enix hasn't shied away from releasing its other Final Fantasy ports outside of Japan, so an announcement for North America and Europe is likely just a matter of time.
Earlier this month, Final Fantasy VI released on Steam, joining the likes of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, and several others. Which entry in Square Enix's beloved role-playing series is your absolute favorite? Let us know in the comments.
