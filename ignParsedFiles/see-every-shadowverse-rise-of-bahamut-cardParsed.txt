See Every Shadowverse: Rise of Bahamut Card - IGN

One of my favourite games this year was Shadowverse, a CCG that took inspiration from the likes of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, but ultimately came to the table with a number of fresh - and strong - ideas and mechanics. The game has already seen one major expansion - Darkness Evolved, and the second will be in the wild on December 29. It's called Rise of Bahamut and contains 105 new cards, with some cool gameplay twists.
