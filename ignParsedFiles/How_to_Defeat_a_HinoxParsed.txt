How to Defeat a Hinox - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are four types of Hinox:  Hinox, Blue Hinox, Black Hinox and Stalnox 
With the exception of the Stalnox, Hinox are always asleep as you approach them. Link can use stealth to climb onto its body to swipe the weapons away from its necklace. When ready for combat, strike its eye with an arrow to wake it up. 
Hitting a Hinox in the eye with an arrow is the easiest way to slow them down.  Using a two-handed weapon on the legs is the easiest way to deal massive damage. The Blue Hinox and Black Hinox will cover their eye up if you start dealing too much damage. Use this as an opportunity to get close to its legs and wail away with your weapons. 
If the Hinox has wooden leg armor, you can light it on fire with using fire arrow. Do not hit the legs with a weapon before destroying the armor as this will reduce your weapons durability. It the armor is made of metal, a shock arrow will do the trick. 
Bows and arrows are essential when fighting a Hinox if you want to leave it vulnerable. Use a Fire Arrow or Shock Arrow for Blue Hinox or Black Hinox. Two-handed weapons, axes, and hammers are great for dealing massive damage quickly, especially if you charge the spin attack. Just double check for leg armor before you swing! 
The bigger the weapon, the better for this type of miniboss!
