FIle for making the machine learning to determine sentence type

1. Consider position in sentence
2. Consider the part of speech in 

If imperative, the program returns a 1

However far back the verb is in sentence, the lower the weight for result imperative.

Sliders for detection




The rest inputs are NOT IMPLEMENTED CURRENTLY
Input 4: Position of noun in sentence	(float)
Input 5: Relative position of noun with respect to verb (float) IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF WE CONSIDER CORRELATION BETWEEN THEM rather than position
Input 6: Position of input 5 in sentence	(float) This might be unnecessary because input 2 and 4 account for it right?


NEW INPUT PARAMS TO ADD: (DELETE INPUT 2)

1: Boolean for "is there a verb" (bool)
2. Is the first word a verb
3: Boolean for "is there a VBZ"   (bool)
4. Is there a gerund in the entire sentence
5. Is the first word a gerund
6. Is there a question mark in the sentence
7. Is there an exclamation mark in the sentence
8. Is there a colon in the sentence
9. Is there a semi-colon in the sentence
10. Is a proper-noun in the sentence*




Calculating the output:

Consider the sentence: "Go ahead, make my day." - this is imperative
The inputs for this sentence will be: [1, 1/7, 1, 6/7, 1/5, 5/7]
There is a verb, and its at the beginning of the sentence.
There is a noun, its the word day and its towards the end.
They are not close so relative position is low.
We're going to have to think about these inputs and the numbers.
But the gist is that you multiply the input vector with the weights.
Get a scalar output.
So now, error becomes:
error = 1 - output
because the closer to 1, the more confident it is that the answer is imperative.

TODO:
Add a script that breaks up a text by sentence and allows you to attach a tag of
sentence type to each sentence, as the script runs through the sentence itself.
