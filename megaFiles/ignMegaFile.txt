100 Percent Completion Checklist - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page lists the requirements needed for 100% Completion in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Walkthrough. There exists in the game a completion rate that you can increase by completing certain tasks in the game. 
The only way you can see what your total completion progress is at is by beating the Main Quest Walkthrough. After defeating the final boss you will be allowed to load the last auto-save before the end, and the save file will have a star that denotes you have completed the game on that save file. 
In this save file, you can look at your map on the Sheikah Slate, and in the bottom left corner alongside the time of day and temperature is a new percentage out of 100% that tracks your total completion. However, this completion percentage ONLY applies to what has been discovered on the map. There is no overall completion percentage for other activities in the game - but you'll also be able to track how many Main Quests, Side Quests, and Shrine Quests you have completed out of the total amount in your Adventure Log. 
Interestingly enough, not everything in the game counts toward a total completion rate, as the percentage only applies to what is seen on the Sheikah Slate's Map - this means things like quests and the Hyrule Compendium don't count to the 100% completion as it is not an overall indicator. In fact, there are only four main categories that are tracked on the map: Dungeons cleared (and their location appearing on the map), Korok Seeds (and the icon that appears once you have claimed a seed), Shrine Discoveries, and Location Discoveries. Each of these will count towards approximately .08% (sometimes you may get a 0.9% increase) of your completion rating. Based on what we know, this boils down to the following - 
While these following categories can be tracked, they are not officially tallied into your completion rating located on the map page. We still recommend you take the time to do them all, if not for the rewards some may have, then for the additional bragging rights and feeling of completion!

Easter Eggs - Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on the Easter Eggs and Secrets found in Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. It's one part of IGN's guide showing you the strategies, Collectibles, and locations you need to know to beat every MGS 5 mission. Check our more of our Metal Gear 5 Walkthrough for more Cheats, Easter Eggs, and Tips and Tricks. 
 


Hideo Kojima is in the game as a prisoner for rescue in Side Ops #112. 
 
 


A radio recording utilized in the horror demo P.T. (Silent Hills) that was originally directed by Hideo Kojima appears as an Easter Egg in Metal Gear Solid 5. 
The radio is located inside a CFA tent in Africa at guard post #17 just up the hill leading towards Ngumba Industrial Zone. 
The news recording details a grisly murder and plays in a radio hidden in a tent just beyond an outpost encampment. This is the same audio recording from the radio in P.T. 

Obtaining Cassette Tape 204863 will give you access to the music present in P.T. 

If you listen carefully in Shago Village, the sound of the swinging chandelier in the foyer of P.T. can be heard in the background. 

If you leave some Skulls alive en route to Code Talker's mansion, a boombox within the mansion will be playing the ending monologue you got upon beating PT and receiving the ending. 
 
 


During the Prologue, the game asks for the player to input their birthdate. Enter a date that is the next calendar day or a couple of days later. 
On the date of the inputted birthdate, start up the game and then return to Mother Base to trigger a special Birthday cutscene with Miller, Ocelot and some MB soldiers. Depending on how far into the game you've progressed, Huey and Code Talker will also appear in the scene. 
If Quiet is at Mother Base, a separate scene will occur with her, where she leaves Snake a special birthday message. 
BIRTH DATE NOTE: If you change the date to your birthday, go into the past and not into the future. Currently the game saves only the newest date. So if today is September 5th of 2015 and your birthday is January 1st and you change the date to January 1st of 2016, when you start to play the game again with the date of September 5th 2015, nothing will save because it is a previous date to the last save. 
 
 


Once the Medical Strut has been constructed, head to the third floor to find a door with a blue light. Go inside and press the button on the white doorway to meet a special character who was thought to be dead. 
Meeting this special character unlocks the "Wandering Mother Base Soldier" Side Ops missions. After completing each mission, give this character the photos obtained from each target to receive additional cassette tapes. 
 
 


If Big Boss spends FIVE in-game days out in the field without returning to the ACC, he'll eventually get so filthy that he starts attracting flies. Returning to Mother Base in this condition triggers a special "welcome back" cutscene featuring Ocelot, some MB soldiers, and a bucket of water. 
 
 


There is an alternate cutscene of Snake's dousing that will occur if Quiet is with you in the ACC. Return to Mother Base in a filthy state and Quiet will give Snake a special shower, much to Ocelot's repulsion. 
 
 


If Snake's bond with Quiet is at 60% or higher, there is a special cutscene that can be triggered when returning to Mother Base. To trigger the scene, Quiet must be with Snake in the chopper and return to Mother Base during rainy conditions. 
When Snake returns to Mother Base, the special scene of Quiet and Snake having some fun in the rain will trigger. 
 
There are three cages in the middle of the Quarantine Platform at Mother Base that Snake can use to house all of the Skulls that he extracts plus the Man on Fire. 

The three types of Skulls that appear are the Mist Skulls (from Mission 1 & 5), the Armor Skulls (from Mission 16 & 29), and the Camouflage Skulls (Mission 28). Two of each Skull will be placed into the cages where they just flail about constantly. As for the Man on Fire, he can be found in the cage behind the Skulls. 
 
There are several unlockable items from Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes that can be used in The Phantom Pain. 
Simply complete all of the Ground Zeroes missions and then transfer the save to your Phantom Pain save to unlock these awesome collectibles. The full list of transfers and unlockables can be found here. 
 

There is a secret way to get Quiet back after Mission 45. Read the full details HERE. 
 

Depending on certain conditions during a mission, Snake can trigger a special cutscene that affects the mission: 
 
 


During the Prologue, you will find a flyer on the bulletin board just outside of Snake's room. The image on the flyer is from the MGS5: Ground Zeroes promo. 
 
Although a smaller reference, when picking up Diamonds, Ocelot has a rare chance to say "That'll fetch a high price." This is a direct nod to the merchant from Resident Evil 4, who has since become well known due to his often repeated lines. To further cement this, Ocelot says the line with a funny voice, clearly trying to mimic the merchant. 
 
In the opening scenes of the game, the nurse in the hospital can be seen rearranging lilies at Snake's beside. This particular type of lily, called "Star of Bethlehem," are seen in the field where Big Boss has his final confrontation with The Boss at the end of Metal Gear Sold 3: Snake Eater. 
 
Located in the courtyard of the Cyprian hospital you are escaping from in the intro is a huge statue of a female figure riding a horse. A closer look reveals that the identity of this figure is almost definitely The Boss from earlier games. 
 

Using binoculars, look at a restroom that is occupied by a soldier with the binoculars to unlock this gross sound file! 
 

After rescuing Miller in Mission 1, press the action button when he asks you to say "the magic words" to respond with some hidden dialogue. 
 
During Mission 12 Hellbound or Side Op 143 you can spot photographs hanging on the AI Pod (or on the ground after the AI Pod flies away). 
One of them shows Strangelove holding a 4-year-old Hal Emmerich, also known as Otacon, Solid Snake's companion during the events of Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 4. 
 
During Side Op #111, Ocelot talks about Quiet and her abilities. He then makes a quick mention of a man that had the same abilities as Quiet in the GRU's Cobra Unit. The man in question is The End, an elite sniper that Naked Snake battled in Metal Gear Solid 3. 
 

Stand near a construction sign warning about falling boxes and look up. You will see a real box appear and fall on your head. 
 
 


When Snake finds Ocelot on Mother Base, shooting him in the head with the tranquilizer gun will make him mutter one of four phrases in sequence. 
1. First is, "That won't work on me, I've had drug resistance training." Though he does trail off while trying to say the last word. 
2. Then he will say: "La-li-lu-le-lo" a reference to the code word for the Patriots in Metal Gear Solid 3.

12 Monkeys: "Witness" Review - IGN

Full spoilers for the 12 Monkeys: Season 3 finale follow. Click here for our spoiler-free overall review of 12 Monkeys: Season 3.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
This is a story that begins at the end and ends at the beginning, so I guess it makes sense that 12 Monkeys has repeated their big twist from Season 2's finale and revealed the identity of The Witness again at the end of Season 3. But for real this time. And wasn't it the greatest? The pay-off was two-fold: one, Cole and Cassie's son isn't evil (whew!) and two, Olivia gets to be the Big Bad she was built to be. We ended up in the same places as we did last year too: the house of cedar and pine in 1959, and Titan in 2163, but everyone was changed, and everything had a different meaning. 
The chase across history that Cassie, Cole, and Athan engaged in before they finally all ended up in 1959 was great fun, showing how far our time travelers have come since their earlier splinting days. Those nifty vests not only help move the story along more quickly, they have a cool steampunk aesthetic to boot.  
This entire remarkable season has revolved around Cassie's unconditional mother's love for her and Cole's child. Almost everyone else seems determined to kill him, is betrayed by Cassie's (and eventually Cole's) decision to hide his identity and try to save him, but her instinct that he wasn't born evil and thus could be saved if separated from the crazy cultists were correct. Cole was right too--nothing bad could come from their time oasis or from their love. It was great how, even with the stakes at their highest, the scene in the house played as parents trying to get their kid on the right path while he rolled his eyes at how they just don't get it, man. 
So, Athan was never the Witness. He was a witness, little w. In a truly insane twist, the real Witness was Olivia. And similar to Ramse's reveal as one of the creators of the time machine, one reason we didn't see it coming was because she didn't see it coming. Olivia has gone from one of the most devoted members of the Army of the 12 Monkeys to it's most disillusioned enemy and now it turns out...she's the god that she was so angry at for not being what she'd hoped. I mean, there's a lot to unpack there but ultimately it suits someone as selfish as Olivia to end up being the source of their own religious devotion. 
One of the weaker elements of Season 3 seemed to be the too quick "is that all it is?" wrap up of Ramse and Sam's involvement in all this, so it was cool that it was actually intentional. We didn't know it, but this is Olivia's story. Thus Ramse and Sam got short shrift because Olivia didn't care about their story, just how they could be used to further hers. 
It certainly makes sense that someone bred to be unbreakable and alone and who was raised in a box would be able to unleash a plague and all the other sick stuff the Witness did/is going to do but it's typically mindbending of this show that she's now going to have to ensure her own awful childhood. Alisen Down makes Olivia so terrifying yet surprisingly sympathetic at times. She was frightened when she first saw, ala Luke Skywalker in the cave, her face in the enemy's mask, but clearly embraces it once she has time to think it over, and kill the false Witness, Athan. Oh, and Pallid Man. He probably deserved a bigger send-off, but like I said before, Olivia's telling this story and she's just so completely over her brother after 200 years of his flower-petal nonsense.
Our time family was torn apart for the latter part of the season, with Jones having gone all Team Olivia, since killing The Witness was at the top of both their to-do lists. That felt a little forced, though she's teamed-up with former enemies Jen, Ramse and Deacon and those alliances sort of mostly worked out so it's not completely implausible. Like everything on 12 Monkeys that doesn't work 100%, it just could have probably used a little more time to develop more satisfactorily. 
Jennifer had a great scene to kick off "Witness" but then took a bit of a backseat role as she and Athan prepped for his trip to 2163, and presumably for the final battle that she will fight alongside the others once they're reunited. The way Jen walked Athan through the "Athan is healing" montage like it was Primary stuff as opposed to TV production stuff was very clever. 
Athan may not have been The Witness, but he clearly has a special relationship to time and his miraculous birth coupled with his ultimate sacrifice definitely gives him that Chosen One cache. I'm sure we'll see many glimpses of the dead next season but is there any chance at all for that "another life" Athan and Cole spoke of when they were saying their goodbyes? It's hard to imagine a way for Cole and Cassie's love to surmount death and destiny to raise a family together, though it's equally hard not to wish for it, too. And Time appears to have a thing for Athan, given that it allowed him to stay conceived, timelines be damned. 
Some questions I still have after watching the finale that I expect will be answered in Season 4: What's the deal with Cole's mysterious mom? Will Cole master the red tea and save the world through his time tripping? Is Virus Meat Man Cole? When is the Cole who saved Cole in "Mother" from? He seemed more evolved than the Coles we know so far. And when will everyone finally just listen to Jennifer?
12 Monkeys ended its stellar Season 3 with an episode that changed our understanding of everything we thought we knew about the story so far.  "The Witness" had plenty of action, but it was the emotional story beats of betrayal, redemption and sacrifice that made the episode soar. Now that our heroes know that Olivia is the key to everything, their mission in Season 4 seems fairly straightforward, though we've been told that there are no straight lines when it comes to time travel.  Could saving Olivia from herself be the key? The killing people gambit never seems to pay off.
Whatever the mission ends up being, it's bound to be made more difficult by the fact that  the Army of the 12 Monkeys no longer has any interest in protecting Cassie and Cole. Waiting for the fourth and final season will be difficult, but if you happen to be Primary and can skip to 2018, please don't spoil it for rest of us

                                                A downloadable version of the Game Boy classic, provided through Nintendo's Virtual Console service.

Link returns in the adventure The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap!

Talk to everyone you meet, or link with friends and fuse Kinstones with them.

5 Things We Learned About Marvel's Defenders Comic - IGN

Writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist David Marquez have been working at the forefront of the Marvel Universe in the past couple years, first establishing a new status quo for Tony Stark in Invincible Iron Man and then tearing the Avengers down the middle in Civil War II. For their next collaboration, Bendis and Marquez are delivering a new take on the Defenders, one that clearly shares a few things in common with the upcoming Netflix show.
Marvel held one of their "Next Big Thing" press calls on Tuesday to shed more light on the new Defenders comic. Both Bendis and Marquez were in attendance, as was Executive Editor Tom Brevoort. Check out this preview art Marvel provided, and then scroll down to find out what was revealed during the call and why fans shouldn't assume this book is a simple cash-in on the Netflix series.

With the team roster being what it is in this series, there's no denying the fact that Defenders is banking on the excitement for Netflix's upcoming Defenders TV series. But Bendis reminded those on the call that he actually set the stage for this series way back in his New Avengers run. All four main characters were included in New Avengers Vol. 2, and the series ended in 2012 with a tease for a potential Heroes for Hire spinoff. Five years later, Defenders is basically making good on that promise, albeit with a different team name.

Things Mass Effect: Andromeda Doesn't Tell You - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Mass Effect: Andromeda features many menus and systems. Some of those have their own secrets. Use these tools and tricks for a smoother exploration and combat experience and get more information about your Ryder in Andromeda. 
Consumables exist! Equip up to four in your loadout (you get two slots when you start) and use them in the weapons menu. Consumables include things like incendiary ammo, cryo ammo, and shield capacitors. 
Ryder can buy and discover consumables in containers. Enemies occasinally drop them as well. 
Save a set of skills and your chosen profile in the Favorites wheel to easily swap between multiple skills. Save a favorite skills loadout in the Skills and Profile menus. The button that pulls up the Favorites menu is listed on the bottom right corner of that menu. You can access the Favorites in the weapons and consumables quick menu. Check out your controls settings to find out which button that is for you. 
This is never explained in a pop-up tutorial, but Ryder is able to quick-cycle through their equipped weapons while in combat, instead of constantly having to use the weapon menu. 
Just hold down X on XB1 or Square on PS4 to switch to your next weapon.

Activities - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There's a lot that can be done in Horizon: Zero Dawn. Activities are just one of the many distractions that can yield loot, or more information about the world. Below are all the activities, and what they do for you. 
These are, as you would expect, camps full of Bandits. Simply walk to them on the map, kill all the enemies inside and you will finish the camp. You're reward is the loot they drop, and a decent amount of XP. 
These robotic strongholds are special areas where you must fight and solve puzzles while venturing deeper into a robot production facility. At the core will be a large machine, and once dead, you can unlock new powers. These upgrade your staff, allowing you to Override more machines. 
Much like Bandit Camps, these are areas marked on the map where Corrupted Machines live. Go in, kill them all and you will clear the zone. Your reward for doing so will be loot and a lot of XP. 
There are 5 hunting grounds located around the map. Each one has 3 different puzzles/battles to win. Beat them all, and you can unlock special new weapons from the Hunters Lodge in Meridian. These are also great for XP, offering huge rewards for completion. 
Scattered around the map are giant machines called Tallnecks. Climb up them, hack into them to learn the data they hold and you will complete that Tallneck. Do this to all of them to unlock map visibility and locations.

Adding Images - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Adding images to a wiki guide is simple. While in the edit view of a page, you'll see a media library in the right column in the Rich Text editor (not the mark-up editor). The "Upload" button allows you to choose up to five image files at a time and upload them into the media library. 
Once an image is uploaded into the media library, it can be placed into the rich text editor by simply clicking on the image thumbnail in the library. The image will appear where you last left your mouse cursor, allowing you to precisely position images within a body of text - the different squares will embed the image as full width or half-width of the page.  
A single image may be inserted to fit the full width of the wiki column. The wiki column has a width of 468 pixels. To mime the appearance of older IGN guides, you may manually adjust embedded images to 468 pixels wide using this setting: 
Use this code for neat, double pairs of images on a page: 
Sometimes you may opt to use three images in a row to detail step-by-step processes. Please use this width/code for placing three images on the same line in our wiki: 
Anything more than this, and we would recommend using videos to illustrate your instructions or solution.

Adding Pages and Sections - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Because IGN's wiki guides are built on MediaWiki's wiki platform, there are multiple ways to create and add pages, but it is preferable you choose one method you are comfortable with and stick with it. 
Locate the navigation box (it's to the left of this text) and at the bottom of the box, there should be a link to "Add Page". When you click on it, it will create a blank page. The first thing you want to do is to determine where the page you are creating should be on the navigation. 
To determine where your page goes on the navigation box, select the left drop-down box. You can place your page "Before" or "After" a particular section in the navigation - note that IGN's style guide mandates alphabetical ordering (numbers and symbols ahead of A to Z) over all else. 
In some cases, you may not need to add a page to the navigation (an example of this page would be achievements and trophies). That option is present in the second drop-down (where all the sections are), as "Do Not Add to Navigation". For most purposes, the before and after options are probably the ones you will use most. 
Once you've determined where you page will be located on the navigation, and before doing more, you need to name the page correctly. Please note that certain punctuation and characters should be avoided in page names - refer to this page for Invalid Page Punctuation. 
The above method is something that let's you add a page to the wiki and update the navigation box all at once. However, you may also add a page after it's created, or put a "place-holder" page first and then edit the page after. To do this, locate the "Edit Nav" link on the navigation box's bottom. 
Clicking the "Edit Nav" link brings you to a tri-column interface to make changes to the wiki's navigation box. You can add a link to a page (or create a placeholder page) by using the "Add Section", "Add Page", or "Add Sub Page" links on each column. 
The middle and right column links appear only after you click on a page in the column left of them; this is to make sure pages and placeholders are organized on the wiki navigation. Remember that when naming a page, there are certain punctuation and symbols you should refrain from using. 
Once you've created the link to an existing page, or the placeholder page, save the navigation. For placeholder pages, you may now find the link on the navigation. Click on it and you should know what to do from there. 
If you are still having trouble with this process, you may ask the staff for assistance.

Adding Spoiler Tags - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This is a brief tutorial on how to add spoilers to IGN's wikis. Spoilers are details that reveal outcomes of stories, plots, events and fates of characters in a television show, movie, book or videogame. 
Oftentimes, spoilers can be handled with a simple announcement at the top of a page using the "Red Box": 
For short, single-sentence spoilers, you may want to use the fancy spoiler tags. If you believe something on our wikis requires the spoiler tag, please use it. Please note that placing the spoiler tag all over a page will result in an ugly page.

Amazon to Release eSports Brawler by Killer Instinct Devs - IGN

Amazon Game Studios has announced Breakaway, a four on four "mythological sport brawler," from Double Helix, the team behind Killer Instinct.
The game's description says it is "made by streamers, for streamers." Your team builds its composition from legendary warriors, each with their own skills, weapons, and Buildables, structures which will change the way the game plays out.
Breakaway's Morgan La Fey
In an interview with Eurogamer, head of Amazon Game Studios OC Patrick Gilmore said: "The teams that invest heavily in Buildables invariably control the entire arena, so it's part of the deeper meta of the game. You can be very good at combat, you can be very good at team composition, but the team that's very good with Buildables is going to have an edge on you."
The hero roster is comprised of a mix of real, fictional, and mythological people, such as Arthurian enchantress Morgan Le Fay, and famous pirate Anne Bonny. Plus, you'll be fighting across locations such as El Dorado, Atlantis, and the river Styx.
Gilmore told Eurogamer the game is very quick to get to the action, which is helped by being able to see the entire playing field at all times. "That made it really effective for strategy as a team sport," he said. "For a broadcaster streaming the game there would never be an opportunity to miss a key action."
Breakaway's Spartacus
For streamers, you'll be able to customize your broadcast with real-time statistics, plus you'll be able to play with your audience using the Broadcaster Match Builder, and interact with them with integrated polls and loyalty point wagering.
If you're looking to get in on the action, you can put yourself on the Alpha waiting list. Keep an eye out for the game's first trailer, which is coming soon.

Amiibo Unlockables, Rewards, and Functionality - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is compatible with Amiibo and supports Amiibo Functionality on both the Wii U and Switch consoles. 
 


Video: What Every Amiibo Does
Players can use a variety of both Legend of Zelda themed Amiibo and non-Zelda Amiibo to scan in to perform a variety of features depending on the particular Amiibo. 
Amiibo can be scanned in using the Sheikah Slate, much like other Runes. Note that by default, the Amiibo Rune is not active and listed on your Runes - you must turn the ability on in the options menu. 
Amiibo can be scanned once a day - but before you scan one, read about this exploit. 
Because the rewards are randomly generated each time you scan an Amiibo, it's very easy to take advantage of. 
Right before scanning an Amiibo, save the game. If you don't like what's inside the chest, simply reload the save and scan the Amiibo again. Repeat until you have the items you want! 
See a list of every Amiibo's function below. 
Zelda-themed Amiibos will summon special chests, some with exclusive equipment, plus a different variety of items that drop outside of the chest sometimes within barrels and crates. Most weapons will not appear in these chests until the Paraglider is received. 
Others will not appear until after the Main Quest, Free the Divine Beasts, have been completed. These special, rare items are noted with an *asterisk. 
The chart below lists what every Zelda Amiibo does. 
 
Virtually all Amiibo not affiliated with The Legend of Zelda can also be used to summon a supply drop of ingredients, but the ingredients are always a random assortment anywhere from three to six - but does not include a chest. 
These Amiibo can be scanned once per day.

Antique Coins - Resident Evil 7 Biohazard Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on how to find and collect the Antique Coins in Resident Evil 7 Biohazard. Antique Coins are used as a form of currency to unlock various items in the game, and finding Antique Coins can be difficult due to their small size and the places they are hidden in. There are 18 Coins to be found on Easy or Normal Difficulty in RE7, and 33 Coins in Madhouse Difficulty - many of which are moved to new locations 
Antique Coins can be traded in for items when you reach the Trailer in the Yard at the end of the Main House. Three birdcages hold three different items: 
Note that in RE7, after leaving the Dulvey Estate at the end of the Boathouse, any cages you have not unlocked will appear one final time at the Safe House at the entrance to the Salt Mines, giving you one last chance to collect rewards. 
 


Antique Coins are located in the following places - note that some of them can only be accessed in a short window, and once missed can never be recovered. 
There is an easily missed collectible that is only accessible if you do a very specific thing while controlling Clancy in the Derelict House Footage tape in the Guest House. As the tape begins, turn around and look on the ground to find a Lockpick. These are used to pick simple locks - like the one in the kitchen. When you enter the kitchen with the would-be ghost hunters, interact with the drawer and unlock it with the Lockpick.

Arrow: Season 5 Review - IGN

Note: this is a mostly spoiler-free review of the fifth season of Arrow, which is now on Netflix. I'll discuss basic character and plot details but save direct spoiler chatter for the end of the review.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
More than any other Arrowverse series, Arrow had a lot to prove when it returned in fall 2016. The series had fallen quite a bit from its peak in the Deathstroke-dominated Season 2. Following the thoroughly disappointing Season 4 finale, Arrow was at its lowest point ever. It wasn't clear at that point whether the show would continue beyond Season 5. Moreover, it wasn't clear whether the show should continue. But thanks to a change in approach, a terrific new villain and a generally more consistent level of execution, Season 5 wound up redeeming a troubled series and recapturing the appeal of those first two years.
Arrow had fallen pretty far down the metahuman rabbit hole in Season 4, what with the focus on supernatural villain Damien Darhk and all the magical tomfoolery that resulted. Even ignoring the various interviews leading up to Season 5's debut, the premiere made it plainly obvious that showrunners Marc Guggenheim and Wendy Mericle were eager to take a "back to basics" approach this year. The series didn't necessarily ignore the more colorful side of the Arrowverse this year, but it did downplay those elements in favor of a darker, more grounded take on Oliver Queen's (Stephen Amell) ongoing crusade. The early episodes were very much about Ollie getting back to his roots and shooting arrows into the criminal scum of Star City.
Initially, there was a worry that the series might be playing things too conservatively, recycling old conflicts and well-worn tropes rather than actually pushing Team Arrow forward in meaningful ways. A lot of that worry was personified in new villain Tobias Church (Chad L. Coleman), a would-be criminal kingpin cut from the exact same cloth as Vinnie Jones' Danny Brickwell. As enjoyable as Coleman's performance was, those similarities were impossible to ignore. Nor did it help that the season introduced another dark-clad archer villain in the form of Prometheus (voiced by Michael Dorn). With little real connection to the Prometheus of the comics, this villain initially came across as a poor man's Malcolm Merlyn.
The other major focus early in the season involved expanding Team Arrow into a true, ensemble fighting force. Alongside returning allies like Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards), Diggle (David Ramsey) and Curtis (Echo Kellum), the team ranks swelled with the addition of up-and-coming vigilantes Wild Dog (Rick Gonzalez), Artemis (Madison McLaughlin) and Ragman (Joe Dinicol). Ollie also assembled a secondary Team Arrow for his new day job of Star City's mayor, with Thea (Willa Holland) becoming his chief of staff and Quentin (Paul Blackthorne) his deputy mayor and new District Attorney Adrian Chase (Josh Segarra) joining the fold. Coupled with a new love interest for Ollie in the form of intrepid reporter Susan Williams (Carly Pope), and the new season was never short on character drama.
Looking back, the biggest flaw with Season 5 is that it tried to juggle more characters and conflicts than was really feasible. The second episode of the season, "The Recruits," exemplified that problem more than any other. That episode focused mainly on Ollie and Felicity's efforts to build the ranks of the new Team Arrow in Diggle's absence. And even though each new member showed promise, there was a strong sense that these new characters were falling over each other competing for limited screen time. The show struck a better balance after that point, but it never felt like there was enough room to do each supporting character justice. Artemis felt especially under-served. The writers never devoted much energy to fleshing out her background or motivations beyond what was already established in her initial Season 4 appearance. That didn't change even after a major Artemis-related twist midway through the season. Susan suffered a similar fate, as she never really developed into a compelling love interest and was treated as little more than a damsel in distress (when she actually appeared at all).
Ragman fared somewhat better. It was nice having at least one metahuman member of Team Arrow just to maintain that bridge to the larger Arrowverse. And the quiet, contemplative Rory made for a welcome counterpoint to testosterone-fueled characters like Ollie and Rene. But Rory was unceremoniously written out of the picture, for no apparent reason other than the fact that he gave Team Arrow too much of an advantage in their war with Prometheus. Between that and the late introduction of new Black Canary Dinah Drake (Juliana Harkavy), it was clear the writers were still fine-tuning and experimenting with the ensemble cast well into the season.
But those problems aside, the show tended to make pretty good use of its supporting cast this year. The unlikely friendship between Quentin and Rene helped both characters immensely and allowed Quentin to do something other than wallow in grief-induced alcoholism for a change. Curtis underwent a memorable transformation this year, finally claiming the "Mister Terrific" name and learning firsthand the terrible toll the costumed vigilante game can take on one's personal life. Even Felicity fared well, with the writers wisely downplaying the Olicity romance and focusing more on her induction into the sinister hacking group Helix.

A Visual History of Wonder Woman's Costumes - IGN

Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic heroes in comics, and it doesn't hurt that she also has one of the most distinctive superhero costumes. But even so, her look has evolved quite a bit over the years as she's made the jump from comics to TV to film and her general role within the DCU has evolved.
With Gal Gadot's Diana Prince taking the spotlight in the new Wonder Woman movie (don't forget to check out our review of the Wonder Woman movie), we thought it would be fun to break down the evolution of Wonder Woman's costume, ranging from her Golden Age debut to her most recent adventures.

The Best Xbox Live Gold Deal - IGN

Microsoft's Xbox Live Gold for Xbox One and Xbox 360 is a continuation of the same service started nearly 15 years ago on the original Xbox. Sony wouldn't introduce its PlayStation Network until 4 years later, making Xbox Live the oldest of the continuously running console services.
Between its online play and free monthly games, Gold is a hugely valuable service, and if you commit to a 12-month membership, there are always deals to be had. If you're still not on-board, even after all this time, here's why you need Xbox Live in your life.

On top of the multiplayer accessibility, an Xbox Live Gold subscription entitles you to free games for both the Xbox One and Xbox 360 every month (see them at Xbox.com). As a bonus, the Xbox 360 games given out each month are part of the Xbox Backwards Compatibility program, meaning you don't need to dust off your Xbox 360 to enjoy them; you can simply play them on your Xbox One.
Microsoft also offers Deals With Gold, giving subscribers discounts on full games, DLC, in-game currency packs, and a lot more (see them at Xbox.com). Basically if it's sold on the marketplace, it might show up in Deals With Gold.

Between the Panels: Diversity Isn't the Real Problem for Marvel Comics - IGN

From a PR standpoint, Marvel didn't have a particularly good weekend. The company held a retailer summit last Friday to discuss their shifting publishing strategy and address concerns about slumping sales. These retailer summits are always interesting because, ostensibly, they are private events where Marvel's reps seem more willing to speak frankly about industry matters. However, ICv2 was there to cover the meetings for the public, which is how we came to hear about the controversial remarks made by Marvel's Senior Vice President David Gabriel.
Between the Panels: The Guardians of the Galaxy Need to Get Bigger - IGN

Now that characters like Thanos and Rocket Raccoon have become household names, Marvel's cosmic-focused comics are more important than ever. The company clearly recognizes that fact. They've placed a lot of muscle behind the Guardians of the Galaxy comics in recent years, ensuring that the team always has at least one ongoing series to its name and plenty of spinoffs and solo series. Just this month alone we're seeing the debut of the twice-monthly All-New Guardians of the Galaxy, the mini-series Guardians of the Galaxy: Mother Entropy, new solo comics for both Rocket Raccoon and Groot and even a comic book adaptation of the new "Mission: Breakout!" ride at Disney World.
At this point, I don't think anyone could argue that Marvel isn't giving this team the attention or creative muscle they deserve. But there is one glaring flaw with Marvel's handling of the franchise lately. No matter where you look - be it comics, movies, animation or video games - Guardians of the Galaxy stories almost always revolve around the same five characters. And as a result, the franchise is beginning to feel a little stale.
All-New Guardians of the Galaxy #1 cover by Aaron Kuder. (Marvel Comics)
At some point it just became accepted that the default Guardians lineup is Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot, despite the fact that that specific roster never existed until the build-up to the first movie. It's the same problem the Avengers faced for several years. There was never an Avengers squad that included just Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye until the first Avengers movie. But once that movie hit theaters, suddenly that specific lineup started cropping up everywhere.
Eventually Marvel eased up on their Avengers synergy. Heck, in the current comics most of those characters are either dead, de-powered or working to overthrow the American government. But Marvel has never done the same for the Guardians. The franchise continues to be driven by those same five characters, despite the huge wealth of cosmic heroes open to Marvel. Whatever happened to characters like Adam Warlock, Phyla-Vell, Mantis and Moondragon? What about Cosmo!?!
If anything, this relentlessly narrow focus has only gotten worse this year. At least writer Brian Michael Bendis made an ongoing effort to fill out the team's ranks during his years-long Guardians run, even if that mainly involved pulling a handful of Earthbound characters like Captain Marvel, Kitty Pryde and The Thing and making them temporary Guardians members. But with the debut of All-New Guardians of the Galaxy, that's done. The roster has been trimmed back down to the core five.

Worse, All-New Guardians seems intent on evoking the movies as much as possible. Groot is stuck in his baby form. Star-Lord can't go anywhere without popping in a cassette tape. The Nova Corps have suddenly morphed from Green Lantern-like heroes to blue collar space cops. None of these sudden changes necessarily detract from the book, but I'm always a little wary of comics that go out of their way to superficially mold themselves after Marvel's movies. The comics are the ultimate source material for everything else. They should be leading the way, not playing "Me too!" Unfortunately, the Guardians and S.H.I.E.L.D. franchises seem to be the two where Marvel struggles most to escape the shadow of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
It's not that Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot aren't great characters who don't deserve to be in the spotlight. It's that they don't deserve to be the only ones in the spotlight. Marvel has way too many cosmic heroes who have lain dormant these past few years. I can understand the desire to make the team approachable and movie-friendly for a while, much as Marvel did with the Avengers back in 2012. But now that we're three years removed from the release of the first Guardians movie, isn't it safe to take greater risks and dig a little deeper into the toy box?
Why is it that the second movie expanded the team roster, yet the comics cling ever harder to that same group of five? Why aren't we at least seeing a greater focus on characters like Yondu, Nebula and Mantis? It's a little bizarre that Marvel is adhering so rigidly to the original Guardians film but not doing much to build synergy between the sequel and the comics.
Whatever happened to these Guardians? Art by Aleksei Briclot. (Marvel Comics)
The appeal with Marvel's cosmic-focused comics is that there's literally an entire universe to explore. Creators can pretty much go anywhere they want and do anything they want with whomever they want. Yet the only series that regularly embraces that idea is Dan Slott and Mike Allred's Silver Surfer. Otherwise, these books are too preoccupied with exploring the same characters and same settings. Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning defined the modern incarnation of the Guardians with their run, and that series was marked by a fluid, ever-changing cast that reflected the constantly evolving cosmic landscape. Marvel has basically taken the opposite approach now.
The general lack of variety in Marvel's cosmic series seems to be getting worse with time, not better. The prolonged absence of the Fantastic Four has been a huge drain all its own. Despite being one of the more critically acclaimed new books of the past six months (and finally appeasing the many Richard Rider fans out there), the new Nova series is already headed for a quick, unceremonious cancellation. It's unclear if Thanos will continue after the departure of writer Jeff Lemire, but I'm not optimistic. Marvel introduced a new heir to the Quasar mantle last year, but outside of her limited role in the build-up to Secret Empire, we've seen very little of this character. More than ever, it seems like those same five Guardians are dominating the cosmic portion of the Marvel Universe.
Marvel is clearly going through a major period of refocusing this year in the lead-up to the Marvel Legacy relaunch. Part of that process needs to involve a change in approach to the company's cosmic properties. It's time to bring back long-dormant heroes like Adam Warlock and Phyla-Vell. It's time to finally expand the Guardians of the Galaxy lineup again. The goal should be to embrace the wide-open canvas that is the Marvel Universe, not focus on greatest hits.

Between the Panels: What Marvel Comics Can Learn From Hellboy - IGN

I don't envy any reader trying to jump into superhero comics right now. Sure, there's a wealth of great material out there, with decades of classic stories and strong new material being published every single week. The problem is trying to figure out what to read and where to start. With books constantly being relaunched, rebooted, re-branded and whatever else, it can be all but impossible to know where to begin and in what order to follow an ongoing series.
That problem was perfectly highlighted by writer Eric Palicki last week, who tweeted the following image showing exactly what happens when someone searches for "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1" on Comixology:
What is a newbie reader supposed to make of that? How are they supposed to know which of those books is the ideal starting point or what exactly the difference is between Guardians of the Vol. 1, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1: Legacy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1: Cosmic Avengers? I can look at those covers and know what stories each book includes and how they all connect to one another, but I read those stores as they were coming out on a monthly basis. If there are any Guardians fans who got turned onto the comics thanks to the new movie, they're in for a lot of hassle and confusion.
The problem extends to all sorts of franchises. Plug phrases like "Uncanny X-Men Vol. 1" or "Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1" into that search window and you're in for a similar shock. Nor is it limited only to Marvel. DC has so many Batman comics in its back catalog that you need some sort of futuristic quantum computer to sort through it all. Even relatively smaller franchises like Vampirella and Bloodshot have become increasingly confusing in recent years because of the constant cycle of relaunches.
The example I always point towards to illustrate how confusing this hobby can be involves Ed Brubaker's Captain America run. Brubaker took over the franchise when Marvel relaunched the series in 2005 as Captain America Vol. 5. That lasted 50 issues or so before the series reverted to its legacy numbering with Captain America #600. That numbering continued for a couple more years until Marvel relaunched the series again in 2011 as Captain America Vol. 6. But even as they relaunched the series, they also debuted a companion Winter Soldier comic. That's to say nothing of the various spinoff projects and mini-series that tied into that run, from Captain America Reborn to Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier to Captain America and Bucky.

It's incredibly difficult to go back and try to read all of that material in its intended order without having some sort of detailed guide. Even if you stick to reading the trade paperback collections rather than the individual issues, it's not an orderly case of moving from Captain America: Book 1 to Book 2 to Book 3 and so on. Instead, the naming scheme changes several times overt the course of that run. After a while, Marvel stopped giving the Brubaker Cap trades volume numbers at all. Readers are essentially left to look up the dates each trade was originally published and hope that they're on the right track.
Why does getting caught up on superhero comics have to be such a hassle? Isn't the point to be entertained, not feel like you're doing homework? Why is this the only form of media that requires so much effort to consume?
There are all sorts of factors involved in explaining why superhero movies don't do more to spark interest in superhero comics, but I think we can all agree that the needlessly difficult barrier of entry is a huge factor. One of the reasons the Walking Dead TV series has boosted readership of the Walking Dead comic is that it's extremely simple to dive into that comic. Whether you prefer to read the series in single-issue format or trade paperback format or through those massive Walking Dead Compendium books, there's a very clear, obvious reading order to follow. Maybe we'd see a bigger influx of readers for Captain America or Guardians of the Galaxy if those franchises were as easy to dive into.
Image makes it incredibly easy to follow this series.
The problem is that it's not really feasible for Marvel to take the Walking Dead route when it comes to publishing most of its comics. Sure, I'd love nothing more than for every ongoing series to stick to one orderly, consistent numbering scheme and stop with the constant relaunches. But those relaunches are often the only thing keeping a lot of books afloat over the long-term. Secret Empire writer Nick Spencer recently spoke to this problem on Twitter:

Black Lightning Explained: Who Is the DC Hero? - IGN

The CW will be adding yet another DC Comics-based series to its lineup this fall thanks to Black Lightning. The series will chronicle the exploits of Jefferson Pierce, a middle-aged metahuman trying to raise two daughters and make his city a safer place. Even with his electricity powers, that task will be easier said than done.
Black Lightning won't be premiering until midway through the 2017-2018 TV season, but it doesn't hurt to brush up o the character now. We're here to break down everything you need to know about this rising star in the DCU.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Black Lightning is among DC's first African American superheroes. A resident of Metropolis' Suicide Slum, Jefferson fights to keep his family and his community safe from gangs like The 100 and crime lords like Tobias Whale, and his innate electric powers make him a serious force to be reckoned with. Jefferson tends to have a unique perspective on crime and evil relative to the heroes of the Justice League. He'd prefer to remain on the street and try to enact change on a local level rather than spend his time high above the world in the JLA Watchtower.
That's not to say the Black Lightning hasn't served with teams like the Justice League and the Outsiders from time to time, but he's more of a loner (which is a good thing given the news that the TV series apparently won't be crossing over with the Arrow-verse). That lone wolf quality stems partly from his desire to keep his powers hidden for much of his early life.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Thanks to an innate metahuman gene, Black Lightning has the ability to create electromagnetic distortions by manipulating his body's bio-electric field. Generally, he uses that ability to fire electrical blasts at his enemies. But through concentration, he can also use his control over electricity for more defensive purposes. He can also create impenetrable force fields around his body and even levitate himself.
Jefferson is also in peak physical condition. He's a former Olympic decathlete who was trained in martial arts by Batman himself. Even without his powers, Jefferson is not a foe to be taken lightly.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Jefferson Pierce made his debut in 1977's Black Lightning #1, making him the first African American character to headline a comic at the company. Writer Tony Isabella has said that Black Lightning was an original creation he was developing at the time, one he chose to bring to DC after being mortified at a work-in-progress African American hero called Black Bomber. Isabella has often quarreled with DC over his belief that he deserves sole credit for the creation of Black Lightning. But the two parties came to an agreement earlier this year, with artist Trevor Von Eeden also receiving credit for his contribution.
The character's first solo series lasted about a year, until it was canceled as part of wider cutbacks at DC (the late '70s being a pretty troubled time for the industry). Black Lightning then became a recurring player in Batman and the Outsiders during the '80s. A second Black Lightning series was commissioned in 1995, though it only wound up lasting a few months longer than the first. Since then, the character has tended to play a supporting role in various other books. He even became Secretary of Education during an extended storyline where Lex Luthor was elected President of the United States. He also finally joined the Justice League proper when writer Brad Meltzer and artist Ed Benes took on DC's relaunched Justice League of America in 2006.
Apart from being a major stepping stone towards a more diverse DC Universe, Black Lightning is also notable for being the rare superhero who's also a father. His daughters, Anissa and Jennifer, have become increasingly important in their own right over the years. They've even carried on the family's superhero legacy, with Anissa becoming Thunder and Jennifer Lightning.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Black Lightning's most famous non-comics appearance doesn't actually involve Jefferson himself. Most seasons of the Super Friends cartoon feature a character called Black Vulcan, a hero with a costume and powers similar to that of Black Lightning. Black Vulcan was created specifically for the show because Isabella's disputes with DC prevented Black Lightning himself from being included.
A Black Lightning by any other name...
Black Lightning has appeared in more recent animated DC projects, however. He's played a role in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Young Justice: Invasion and the direct-to-DVD animated movie Superman/Batman: Public Enemies (which adapts the aforementioned President Luthor storyline).
Jefferson's daughters have also been in the spotlight recently, as they starred in a series of Thunder and Lightning-themed animated shorts for Cartoon Network's DC Nation block. Of course, where the character goes in his live-action debut on The CW remains to be seen...

Black Lightning Not Part of Arrowverse, Won't Be Part of CW's Next DC Crossover - IGN

Greg Berlanti's upcoming DC series Black Lightning is not set within the The CW's Arrowverse.
As reported by Entertainment Weekly, The CW president Mark Pedowitz confirmed today, prior to the network's upfront presentation, that Black Lighting is not part of The CW's shared DC universe, and as such won't be part of its next DC crossover.
"We do not aim to do a five-way crossover," Pedowitz told reporters. "Black Lightning, at this time, is not part of the Arrowverse. It is a separate situation. But there will be a big fourth quarter crossover with all four of the shows that are on in the fall."
It's worth noting that all of The CW's Arrowverse shows film in Vancouver, while production on Black Lightning takes place in Atlanta. Couple that with the fact that Black Lightning won't debut until midseason, and one can see why Berlanti's new show doesn't share a universe with the rest of The CW's DC lineup.

Blood Moon - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Blood Moon is an eerie mechanic in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that enhances Ganon's power, allowing the spirits of fallen enemies to return to life by the red glow. 
Link will not experience a Blood Moon until he leaves the Great Plateau. The first time unsettling music plays, ashes levitate in the air, and the sky glows red, Princess Zelda will narrate the scene with the following: 
"... Link... Link... Be on your guard. Ganon's power grows...it rises to its peak under the hour of a Blood Moon. By its glow, the aimless spirits of monsters that were slain in the name of the light return to flesh. Link...please be careful." 

There are a few effects to look out for under the red moon, the most obvious one being that enemies return from the dead. There are a few other, beneficial, effects as well. 
Every time the Blood Moon rises, everything in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild comes back to life (except your horses. Sorry). This includes monsters and guardians, even those inside shrines, so the world will never run dry of monster parts to farm. 
If you remember where the combat trial shrines are, you will always be able to stock back up on free, incredibly powerful Ancient Weapons, perfect for defeating Guardians in the overworld. 
Be extra careful if you notice a red moon overhead (you can see it starting around 9 p.m. in-game). You may want to avoid entering enemy camps or engaging Minibosses and bosses until after the Blood Moon passes at midnight. Enemies, including bosses, will regain all of their health after a Blood Moon! 
This can be to your advantage if farming Lynel parts for example, but it's difficult to plan for considering the Blood Moons are random. 
Good things come back with the Blood Moon, too, including weapons, items, and enemy encampment chests. Ingredients like fruit and mushrooms come back as well, but these regrow naturally after a few in-game days pass regardless. 
Consider placing stamps where you can find your favorite weapons lying around so you can return to collect them after a Blood Moon. 
 
Sometimes when cooking, you will hear an extra musical tune at the completion of cooking a dish. This notifies you that you had a critical success! You'll see one of the following benefits after a critical cooking success: 
There's a small window at night during a Blood Moon where all of your cooking endeavors will result in a critical success, guaranteed. Start cooking at 11:30 p.m. in game to get the bonus, but once the cinematic plays at midnight, you will no longer receive it. There's an easy-to-access cooking pot across from Ha Dahamar Shrine at Dueling Peaks Stable you can fast travel to in a hurry if you want to take advantage of a Blood Moon. 
 
Some NPCs, like Hino at Dueling Peaks Stable, act quite oddly during a Blood Moon. Be on the lookout for strange behavior when the sky is red. 
As Hino says, Blood Moons occur during unlucky nights at midnight. This is seemingly random after every few days pass in-game, but some players have theorized it will occur more often the more enemies are slain. 
The effects of the Blood Moon, like cooking bonuses, begin at 11:30 p.m. in-game, and end after the cutscene plays at midnight. 
 
Many players have reported glitchy Blood Moons that happen every day or at times other than midnight. This may be more likely to happen if the The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been on for an extended period of time. Make sure to turn off your game every time you're done playing to possibly avoid this glitch.

Cable #1 Review - IGN

Marvel is banking pretty heavily on '90s nostalgia when it comes to the ResurrXion relaunch. Hot on the heels of X-Men Gold, X-Men Blue and a new incarnation of Generation X, Cable is back in his own solo series. Luckily, one needn't already be a fan of this gun-toting, time-traveling cyborg assassin to enjoy what James Robinson and Carlos Pacheco are delivering.
Robinson has really found his niche at Marvel these past couple years. Cable continues the approach of books like Scarlet Witch and Nick Fury, books that reflect current Marvel continuity but focus more on telling clean, approachable stories set in their own little corners of the Marvel U. Cable doesn't follow the standalone issue format of those books, but otherwise is cut from a similar cloth. Robinson doesn't burden readers with Cable's convoluted history or an excess of plot in this first issue. Instead, he throws them right into the middle of Cable's latest time-hopping adventure. It's not clear who or what Cab;e is pursuing in this first issue, but clearly this is a case where the journey is more important than the destination.
There can be a fine line when it comes to plot-light, action-heavy books like this. The pared-down, straight-to-the-point approach is all fine and well, but there needs to be at least some depth and nuance to the characterization to keep readers invested. That's been the problem with Nick Fury so far, to be honest. But Cable falls on the other side of that line. The script is streamlined and light on exposition, but it manages to shed light on Cable's personality in subtle, effective ways. In particular, the scene involving Cable consoling a grieving Japanese woman speaks a lot to his character with only a handful of words and images.
Carlos Pacheco makes for a strong storytelling partner. Pacheco's style evokes the classic '90s era just enough to suit the lead character. There's also a very clean, sleek quality to his pencils that helps immensely with the streamlined storytelling approach. Robinson has no need to rely on narration of exposition when Pacheco's dynamic framing choices and emotionally charged characters get the job done on their own.
More so than with many artists, Pachecho's art tends to vary in quality a lot depending on which inker and colorist he's paired with. Luckily, Cable pairs Pacheco with a strong team in inker Rafael Fonteriz and colorist Jesus Aburtov. Fonteriz's thin but confident lines bring extra clarity to Pacheco's work, and Aburtov's colors give the book a rich quality. Aburtov is especially skilled at capturing the sun-drenched vistas of the Wild West and the dramatic scenes human suffering in Feudal Japan.
Cable immediately establishes itself as one of the stronger additions to Marvel's ResurrXion lineup. This first issue offers a tightly paced, attractive romp as the cyborg hero hunts a mysterious enemy across time. And fortunately, the book is able to add just enough depth and complexity to its main character to balance out the light, breezy storytelling approach.

Big Story
WW2 (World War 2) is the 2017 entry in the long-running Call of Duty franchise, and the 13th core game in the series (there are now seventeen including the various PC and console exclusives and expansions). 
 


Returning from the future to their historic roots, WW2 focuses on the conflict between Allied and Axis powers between 1938 and 1945. Instead of taking on the role of multiple different Allied soldiers across all of the theatres of the war, players will instead find themselves inhabiting the boots of a single U.S. army recruit as they fight through Operation Overlord and across the western front of the war.

Captain Kid: Volume #1 Review - IGN

"You're only as old as you feel" is a nice adage, but at some point reality begins to outweigh optimism. It could be one year or 30, but at some point you feel it -- a confounding ache, a never ending hangover -- and in that that moment you realize that certain things were a lot easier before you put on some years. So what if you could go back to that younger, ideal you? And more importantly, what if that you also came with super powers? That's the question Mark Waid, Tom Peyer and Wilfredo Torres present in their emotionally strong but narratively sporadic first volume from AfterShock Comics.
In overly simple terms, Captain Kid is essentially a reverse Billy Batson. Rather than a young boy turning into a muscle bound adult, Kid's Chris Vargas instead reverts from a creaky, middle-aged man with bladder issues to a super strong, ab-tastic teenager. It's wish fulfillment of the highest order, and its easily the most engaging part of this series. Writers Waid and Peyer do an excellent job of laying the emotional groundwork of the series early on. Chris is a bit of a sad sack when we first meet him, with a dead end job and ailing father to go along with the aforementioned physical ailments. And yet, he's not a loser -- he's a sharp guy with caring friends, just one feeling the grind of a life halfway lived. And when he changes into Captain Kid, those problems don't disappear. Flying doesn't pay the bills, electromagnetism cant help his loved ones -- his powers are a gift to be sure, but Chris and Kid lead almost entirely separate lives.
It'd be easy to look at that dichotomy in a wholly negative way, but Waid and Peyer rarely let Chris fall into self pity. He finds true joy in his powers, using them to help people in myriad ways, but he's also aware enough to know that his life is what it is, powers or not. Some of the book's most affecting scenes come through that realization, and while the book's more emotional moments can read a bit rough, they don't rob the character of his general positivity. It's an assured take, and one that makes the rest of the narrative feel undercooked by comparison. Where Chris makes sense from page one, some of the book's other elements are less successful. There's a glut of side plots here, from a time traveling accomplice constantly at war with different versions of herself to a villainous businessman whose idea of world domination encourages retail therapy. Add in trouble both at work and at home and you get a lot of moving parts, so much so that the pacing of the series often suffers. Certain transitions come from seemingly nowhere, where other plots taper off with little resolution.
That confusion spills into the book's art at times, though Wilfredo Torres turns in a mostly strong first volume. Some of his layouts are tough to follow, his panels not always leading to clean transitions from one to the next, but its tough to say whether or not that falls on him or the script itself. It is easy to give Torres credit for much of the character work exhibited here. While he doesn't go overboard with detail, Torres shows a great eye for expression, his characters showing plenty of personality through their various physical quirks. When Chris transitions to Captain Kid he's not just physically younger but emotionally unburdened, and that joy radiates from the page. Conversely, we never forget the wealth of experience that resides in Kid's younger form, a testament to Torres' nuanced ability. Kelly Fitzpatrick also deserves mention, her strong color work doing an excellent job of fitting the various moods the script presents. The fill-in issue by Brent Peeples is also solid, though it would have been nice to see Torres tackle those emotional moments.
Though busy and at times borderline confusing, Captain Kid's first volume succeeds on the sheer will of its strong creative team. While unrealistic, Chris Vargas is never anything less than fully relatable, and its that assured take that gives Waid, Peyer and Torres their base for further adventures down the road.
An emotionally strong but narratively sporadic tale, Captain Kid's first volume is a mixed bag. Mark Waid and Tom Peyer have made a familiar idea feel new again, and in Chris Vargas they have an Everyman with lasting appeal. Some confusing transitions and odd pacing choices deter some of that goodwill, but the nuanced art by Wilfredo Torres goes a long way in keeping investment high. Rough spots aside, theres enough here to look forward to more Captain Kid down the line.

After some more plot exposition, you'll gain control of Heihachi and will have to fight the Tekken Force soldiers. 
The fight here is simple, you'll just have to defeat each of the soldiers that attack you. The Tekken Force isn't that strong compared to you, but can deal damage if you let them. Each soldier will go down rather quickly with a few hits. Keep doing this until all of the soldiers are defeated an another cutscene is triggered. 
The next portion of the fight will have you facing off against Nina Williams. This acts like a traditional Tekken battle, but with a few stipulations. You need to defeat Nina twice, with the second time refilling her health and triggering Rage Mode. Other than this, the match will play out the exact same.  
Use your skills to attack Nina and bring her health down both times. This isn't a hard fight, so you shouldn't have too much trouble facing her. Once Nina is defeated, a cutscene will trigger and play out till the end of the chapter.

Chapter 2 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
After the cutscene at the beginning, you'll watch a scene from an event that happened during Tekken 4. This was when Kazuya and Heihachi had to fight off a group of Jack units that were storming the temple the two of them were at after fighting against Jin during the events of Tekken 3. Heihachi and Kazuya must team up against the Jack units as they attack. 
During the first part of this battle, you'll control Kazuya and will need to defeat a number of Jack-4 Units. The Jack units are very similar to the Tekken Force soldiers from the previous chapters. However, this time the Jack units will deal more damage when they hit and are slower moving. Take down each Jack-4 as they appear, when the fighting starts however you'll have to block immediately. Each Jack will enter the area with an attack that you will get hit by if you aren't careful. 
You'll take down about 5 Jack-4 units before the scene continues onward. After a short part of the cutscene, you'll gain control of Heihachi for the remainder of the battle. You'll then face another group of Jack-4 units that will atatck you in the same way as they did when you controlled Kazuya. 
Fight off the Jack units the same way you did before. Once you take down the last Jack-4, the cutscene will trigger and play out to the end of the chapter.

Chapter 3 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
After a long narration and cutscene, the story will take you to Italy and place you in control of Heihachi. After some plot exposition, you'll have to fight Claudio in the Church stage. At the start of the fight, you'll need to immediately crouch and avoid Claudio's bow attack. You have very little time to avoid this as soon as the cutscene is over and the fight begins. 
Once you do so, fight Claudio like normal and defeat him. Watch out for his charge armor attack that allows him to absorb hits. When he does this, and he will frequently, he'll go right through any of your attacks and deal massive damage. Just the same, duck under Claudio's bow attack when he charges it up. 
When you take down Claudio the first time, he'll get back up and become enraged. Both of your health meters refill, but you won't recieve a Rage Mode boost at all. Fight Claudio in the same way with extra caution this time, he'll do more damage with attacks by being in this enraged state. 
Once you defeat Claudio, a cutscene will trigger and play out till the end of the chapter.

Chapter 4 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The beginning of the chapter gives a background on the legacy of the Mishima Clan. Another cutscene will play afterwards and lead into a new location and new character to play as. Eventually you'll be put in control of Lars and will need to fight off the Mishima Zaibatsu soldiers. The fight starts with you holding a gun in third person. Use the button prompts to fire the assault rifle and attack the soldiers. 
If you are hit while holding the assault rifle, you'll immediately revert back to noral status and will have to fight the soldiers head-on. You can always pull back out the gun with the input shown on the screen, but if you find it difficult to aim with the gun then just fight the soldiers normally. The soldiers don't have a lot of health, but will attack viciously by mixing up their physical and ranged gun attacks. 
Once all the soldiers are defeated, another cutscene will play towards the end of the chapter.

Character Creation - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on the Character Creation system in Mass Effect Andromeda. 
 


Multi-layered character creation has been a staple of the Mass Effect franchise since the first game. Players are able to not only customize the name and appearence of Pathfinder Ryder, but also their skills, abilities and backstory. 
In a dramatic shift from traditional Mass Effect style, players will no longer be required to select a specific class (such as Solder, Adept, Infiltrator, etc) at the onset of their adventure. 
Instead, Ryder has access to all of the potential skills that Alliance training has to offer, and can choose to focus on as many or as few ability types as they choose. These skills can also be reset and reassigned at any time, allowing players to change their playstyle between - and potentially even during - missions. 
When beginning a new game with a custom Ryder, players are not only given the option to alter their appearance but also select a starting array of abilities for them to use. The initial skill options are: 
Security: Concussive Shot, Turbocharge, Combat Fitness 
Biotic: Throw, Singularity, Barrier 
Technician: Overload, Invasion, Team Support 
Leader: Energy Drain, Annihilation, Team Support 
Scrapper: Charge, Combat Fitness 
Operative: Tactical Cloak, Combat Fitness 
While the requirement of a specific class may no longer be present, players can still choose to specialize their characters with specific ability profiles. 
For example, after investing enough points into Biotic abilities, players will unlock the Adept profile, which offeres bonuses to using exclusively biotic-based abilities. If, however, they player has focused on a combination of Biotic talents and Combat abilities, they will unlock the Vanguard profile. 
Another aspect of character customization that's new to Mass Effect Andromeda is the ability to customize other characters than just your own. 
Players will not only customize whichever of the two Ryder twins they choose to play as, but also be able to affect the other sibling and their father, Alec. This means they will see a difference in appearance (and potentially ability) from both their own different Ryder profiles and other players. 
While it is still unknown whether these changes will be made manually or automatically based on your playable character build, it should prove interesting to see how the family dynamic changes with this update.

Cheat Codes - The Sims 4 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
 


Cheats Codes return in The Sims 4 allowing you to do all sorts of things, like get infinite money (Simoleons) or turn off death. 
To enter Cheat Codes in The Sims 4, you must first open the Cheat Console. The Cheat Console can be brought up by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+C on a PC or COMMAND+SHIFT+C on a Mac. Input the following text into the text input field that appears at the top of the screen. Typing help lists all available commands into the command console (this will only list cheats available to the players). 
Players can make their Sim's dreams come true and complete various life-long goals by entering aspirations.complete_current_milestone. 
It is also possible to improve (or degrade) a Sim's proficiency for certain skills:stats.set_skill_level [skilltype] 1-10Enter the above command into the console, then replace [skilltype] with one of the following ID's: 
Testing cheats allow players to edit the attributes of Sims, items, textures and objects. To enable or disable Testing Cheats enter: 
Entering testingcheats true will open up editing options in-game for Sims, such as changing their age, motivations and goals and emotional states. Once testing cheats are enabled, players can also improve their Create-A-Sim experience by entering cas.fulleditmode into the command console. This will allow them to alter Sims in ways that are normally unavailable, including traits, styles and outfits. 
Cheats and Secrets - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page collects cheats, secrets, exploits, and other tricks for Horizon: Zero Dawn that allow you to get easy XP, infinite ammo, and invincibility. Know something we don't? 
The short version: reloading a save will restore your health bar and any ammo for a heavy weapon if you're carrying one when you save. 
 


Heavy Weapons are items that can be collected from powerful enemies, such as the Ravager's cannon, Thunderjaw's disc launcher or a Deathbringer heavy machine gun. 
Once you collect the weapon, simply make your way back to a campfire and perform a save while you still have some ammo left. Reload the save to refill your ammo. 
Ravagers, Thunderjaws and other large beasts will all succumb rather easily to these heavy weapons, which makes this exploit great for grinding for XP and leveling up quickly. 
There is a hidden armor called "Shield-Weaver", which renders Aloy (almost) invincible. The armor contains a rechargeable shield that absorbs all incoming damage, including falling damage. If the shield is close to failing, it will blink red and emit a high-pitched alarm sound. 
 


The Shield-Weaver can be found by completing the quest Ancient Armory and finding all five hidden Power Cells throughout the game. 
The tearblaster is a somewhat hidden weapon. Unlike other weapons it cannot be bought from merchants. It's a quest reward for side quest "Hunter's Blind". This gives you a treasure box with this weapon inside. It shoots compressed air to take off a machine's armor and components. This can be very useful against certain types of enemies, especially the ones that carry weapons on their backs.

Combat - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Combat has changed a lot from previous iterations of the franchise. This page will list some of these changes and new features in the game. 
The stamina meter makes a return from Skyward Sword, only it plays a larger role in combat, as it is needed to both attack, charge up moves, and defend against strong attacks. If Link's stamina is completely deplated, he will be unable to perform most actions until it completely fils up again. 
Attacks can be performed in a variety of ways, both in L targeting and without. 
If you jump out of the way as an enemy attacks, you can initiate a slow-mo mode. The same can happen with a perfectly timed shield block. This slow-mo mode allows Link to perform a flurry attack with his weapon to rapidy slash at them before they finish falling to maximize damage. 
If you counter an enemy when it swings a weapons, you can sometimes disarm them. A disarmed any will use any attack it can. Disarmed enemies may throw rocks at you. If you time the swing right, you can smack a rock back at the enemy. 
Link is more easily staggered in combat, and larger attacks will knock him to the ground, where he will be stunned for a brief moment before getting back to his feet. 
If Link is sneaking, and the enemy is asleep or unaware, he can even perform a sneakstrike to deal massive damage without alerting others nearby. 
You can also initiate slow-mo by jumping off a high location and pulling out your bow, or by jumping off of your horse. Bow shots can be made either while manually aiming or using L-targeting, and there are different kinds of bow ammunition. 
Getting a head shot with a bow can deal massive damage, often killing the foe instantly if they are weak enough.

Common Beginner Mistakes - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page will document some mistakes Beginner editors often make, and how to avoid them. 
This one is very important, and knowing it will save you a lot of time. When adding a link to a page inside the same Wiki, you do not need to paste in the full link. 
For example, you want to link to the Walkthrough page in the Guacamelee or The Wonderful 101 Wiki(s) from within the Guacamelee or the Wonderful 101 Wiki(s). Instead of clicking the Link button in the Rich Text Editor and writing ' http://ign.com/wikis/guacamelee/Walkthrough ' into the box, you need only write in the name of the page. In this case, simply write 'Walkthrough', or another context-appropriate hyperlink. 
Alternatively, if you are using the Wiki Markup Editor, you would type: 
As opposed to this: 
Often, if a page is light on content, an editor will repeat the name of the page as a Header directly underneath the main Title, as in this page: Animal Crossing Birthday Of Residents 
This is not a useful edit. The main Title is prominent at the top of the page, and the reader already knows the subject of the page.

Confidants - Persona 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The following is IGN's Confidants guide for Persona 5. Confidants are Persona 5's version of Social Links. Building relationships with your confidants will give you more abilities, bonuses, and items as you progress and they are a cornerstone of the Persona series. 
Spending time with your confidants will be your primary source of game time outside of Palaces. Use your time well as you don't have forever. Some days, confidants will be around in their locations, but you won't be able to spend time with them. 
In most cases, you'll get a text from someone who wants to hang out with you, usually to progress your social link with them, but sometimes you have to go and look for them. The best way to do that is by bring up your map to see which areas have the blue card icon and then hitting Square over the location to see who is available. If it says "Up!!" over their name, you can rank up with them. If their name is greyed out, that means you either have not reached a requirement of their social link or you haven't spoken to them since you reached the requirement. If you just see a blue card, that means you need to spend time with them before you can get to the next rank.

Datapoints - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The datapoints represent one of the many Collectibles found in Horizon: Zero Dawn. Each one you collect unlocks a new tidbit of lore, filling in gaps in the story of the old world. 
Below is a list of all the Datapoints in the game, where to find them, and the text or audio you obtain from each Datapoint. 
This datapoint is found in the ruins you explore as a kid, but can also be obtained by returning there as an adult. 
On the first level, in the North-East corner of the map, you find a room with several dead people. One is Connor, and can be scanned to obtain a second log from him. 
CONNOR CHASSON: ...I mean, seriously, "record our thoughts for posterity"? ...I mean, seriously, "record our thoughts for posterity"? Like I wouldn't be... here... like this... if not for posterity? I'm done with posterity. Posterity can go... 
This datapoint is found in the ruins you explore as a kid, but can also be obtained by returning there as an adult. 
On the first level, in the North-East corner of the map is a room filled with beds and several dead people. One is Skylar, and the body will give you the log. 
SKYLAR RIVERA: And Machu Picchu. Always wanted to see that. Never did. Why didn't I go with Owen when he asked? Stupid. I should have gone. Well. 
This datapoint is found in the ruins you explore as a kid, but can also be obtained by returning there as an adult. 
On the first level, in the North-East corner of the map is a room filled with beds and several dead people. The body in question this time is in the south end of the room, laying in a bunk. 
ELLA PONTES: And maybe that's all I need, you know? That moment the door opened and you were standing there, wearing that retro-weave dress, and the way you smiled... I had to look away or you were going to see. On my face. What had just... blossomed inside me, you know? Ha. It was just an instant, but I knew. I knew we'd be forever 
This datapoint is found in the ruins you explore as a kid, but can also be obtained by returning there as an adult. 
Day of the Tentacle Remastered Review - IGN

Day of the Tentacle was a very, very funny point-and-click adventure in 1993, and it remains funny today. The plentiful jokes are punchy, wickedly morbid, and delightfully diverse enough to satisfy a wide range of comedic palates.

I chatted with Bourne Identity and Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman today about his upcoming true crime movie American Made (look for that interview next week), during which time I also asked him about two high-profile comic book movies he's dropped out of directing: Justice League Dark (aka Dark Universe) and Gambit.
Liman had been talking up Justice League Dark as recently as last month before the news broke that he had parted ways with the project. In that case, Liman's plate was simply too full to end up accommodating the DC Comics adaptation.

Preparations continue as the Tournament of Power draws ever closer. Opting to keep things relatively relaxed, Episode 92 focused again on the activities going on in several other universes, one of which set a new record for the long-running series. Not all was so well handled, though, as a silly moment involving our heroes ruined what could've been a more compelling storyline.
Dragons - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Three Dragons are found in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. They areancient and primordial spirits that take the form of incredibly huge and powerful dragons that cannot be harmed by mere mortals. 
These dragons each serve the goddesses and are associated with each of the ancient springs. 
Soon after starting your adventures beyond the Great Plateau, you may be lucky enough to witness one of these ancient spirits making its way across the land of Hyrule. These dragons are not explicitly aggressive, but they do have certain defenses to ward off the unworthy. When a dragon appear close, the music will change, and large updrafts will appear around the dragon, letting Link use his Paraglider to move in close with unlimited stamina. However, each dragon will also summon elemental orbs that can strike Link and cause damage - making him fall out of the sky. Each dragon can be found in a different part of Hyrule, usually beginning their flight around sunrise and finish around sunset.

Dungeon 1 Gnarled Root Dungeon - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The road to the first dungeon of Oracle of Seasons takes you to the Hero's Cave, The Maku Tree and finally to the Gnarled Root Dungeon, which is guarded by Aquamentis. 
You'll notice that the beginning of Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages are very similar. In Seasons, Link meets up with Din, the Oracle of Seasons (fancy that), at a camp just to the east of the starting point. Speak to each of her companions at the camp, then talk to Din herself and she'll ask you to dance. Boogie with her for awhile until the General of Darkness, Onox, steps in to ruin the party. He says a bunch of evil stuff, then grabs Din and spirits her away, sequestering the young beauty in the Temple of Seasons. This causes the seasons in the world to go all wacky-like. They're all scrambled, and you'll need to restore that power in order to set the world right. 
Impa, Din's attendant (and ulitmately an employee of Princess Zelda) tells you that she and Din were on their way to Hyrule. But that plan was trashed when Onox came and carted off the swarthy redhead. Now Impa pleads with you to take up the quest. Why not? You're a hero. And you have nothing better to do. After all, weren't you just going to cut some grass and look for Rupees all day? Might as well do it in association with a quest. 
Impa tells you to see the Maku Tree, who resides in Horon Village, the capital city of Holodrum. Like in Ages, the Maku Tree is the questmaster, giving you clues on where to head next, and providing you with items to dispel evil. They just don't make trees like this anymore. Unlike the Tree in Ages, this Maku is a manly tree. But before you can visit him, you're going to need to pick up some gear. 
To do this, you'll need to get a Sword. Head to the west side of Horon Village, then move down the path here out of town, past an Octorok and through the field of rock. The path will bend south. Follow it down to the beach, then enter the cave in the northern rock wall. This is Hero's Cave. 
 
Since you don't have a weapon yet, avoid the Keese in the first room and exit to the east. Push the block in this room up one space to open a door to the north. Exit north and push the block here up one space, opening a path. Follow it around to a set of blocks. Push the left one down and the righht one right to get through. Exit the room to the east. Avoid the Keese and Gels in the next chamber, stepping on the floor switch on the right side of the room. A chest will drop from the ceiling. Inside is a Small Key. Once you have it, move through the previous room back to the chamber with the single block in it. Push it one space in any direction to open all of the doorways here, then leave through the southern one. 
In the next room, you'll see four blocks. You can't move them yet, so avoid the Keese and use your key on the locked door on the right. In the next room, you'll find a group of Gels. Avoid them and move to the upper left corner, stepping on the floor switch there. This will open a door on the north end of the room. Move around the channel in the floor and exit to the north. There is a dais in the next area with a chest atop it. Climb the stairs and open it to discover the Wooden Sword. 
Once you've got it, you will find yourself back outside the cave. If you need some healing, head to the cliff above the cave and enter this upper cavern entrance. You've found a fairy fountain! Return here whenever you're low for a full heal-job. If you want some more goodies, head back outside. Hack the plant on this ledge with your Sword, then hop down into the chute below. This will send you back inside Hero's Cave. Search the chest here for 30 Rupees. Then head back to the room with four blocks. Push the upper left block one space down to open a staircase in the lower right corner of the room. Go down the stairs to find a Gasha Seed. 
Once you have everything, leave the Hero's Cave and return to the village. Head to the east side of the village and climb the steps to the Maku Path, using you Sword to break down the gate. Follow the path north to talk to the Maku Tree. You find the old wooden geezer sleeping. Pop his spit bubble with your Sword and he'll wake up right quick. When you talk to him, the tree tells you how he dropped the ball in watching Din and where you might find Onox (duh duh duuh). But you'll need all eight essences. Then you can tell the old general to backdaheckup. He gives you a Gnarled Key and tells you to take it to the giant root near the lake to the north. 
This is a good time to explore town. Take a look at the Ring Shop on the south side of town and Vasu will walk you through how the Ring system works. Visit the Shop (to the east) and buy a Shield if you have the means. If you have any questions about how the game is played, go see the Know-It-All Birds in the northwest corner of town. 
Once you're done checking our Horon Village, head to the middle of town and take the path north, going past Impa's house. Keep going north until you see a bridge leading off to the west. Go across it to find the Gnarled Root. Use the Gnarled Key on it to access the very first dungeon. 
Head through the first room of the dungeon into a chamber with four blocks and a few plants. Hack the foliage to bring out some healing fairies. Push the upper right block one space in any direction to open all of the doors. Exit through the right door. In the next room, kill the Stalfos to bring a Small Key from the ceiling. Grab it and return to the previous room. Use the Key on the west door. 
In this next room, kill the Stalfos. This will do two things: open a door to the north and bring a chest down from the heavens. Look inside it to find the Dungeon Map. Then leave through the north door. Defeating the Gels here will reopen the door that slams shut behind you. Instead of leaving through the southern exit, get in the mine cart and ride it to the north. Ride it up and through the next room. You'll be deposited in a room with a pair of red Moblins. Slay them and push the block one space down, opening a door on the left wall. Trigger the pinching blades, then wait for them to retract and run through. 
Make your way through the block puzzle at the bottom of the room, then scale the short staircase in the northwest corner of the room. On a platform here, you'll find a chest containing a Gasha Seed. Gosh! A Seed! Hop off the platform here and return to the room with the mine cart. Instead of getting in it, climb the stairs just north of it and move to the right until you see a switch on the ground. Whack it once to change the tracks, then continue east until you find a chest. Inside is a Compass. Grab it, then return to the mine cart and get it. 
The cart will track through a couple of rooms. When you pop out of it, walk back to the left and search the chest for some Bombs. Grab them, then climb the steps above the mine cart. Move a little to the right and go down the set of stairs here. Follow the narrow path down, moving past a spinning blade. Curl up and around the corner, stepping on the floor switch here. This will drop a chest from the sky. Inside is a Small Key. Grab it, then loop around and climb the stairs again. Atop the platform, move to the left until you see an irregularity in the north wall. Place a bomb under it to open a passage in the wall. Weave through the maze in the following room, teasing the blades to bring them out and using the cubbies to duck into so you won't get hit. Make your way to the north side of the room. Here, you'll see a pair of plants. Cut them down to get a healing fairy. Exit to the north to find the mini-boss. 
The Goriya Brothers share a single boomerang which they really like to throw back and forth. The problem happens when you get in their way. Ultimately, if you can predict where the boomerang will go, these guys will be pretty easy to beat. 
Just dodge the whirling 'rang and slay the Brothers with your Sword. When they drop, you'll get a healing fairy and a portal back to the first room in the Dungeon. Grab the fairy and leave through the west door. 
In the following room, dodge the pinching blades that greet you at the door. Move all the way to the left side of the central diamond. Push the leftmost block one space up to gain access to the staircase inside. Go down the stairs to find yourself in a side-scrolling cave. Here, you'll find the Seed Satchel, which is full of Ember Seeds. 
Go back upstairs and return to the mini-boss room. Step through the portal to be taken back to the Gel room. Equip the Ember Seeds and drop one on each torch on the left wall to open the door here. Head through and defeat the boomerang-chucking Moblins. A chest will appear containing the Boss Key. Grab it and go back to the previous room, then exit to the south. Kill the Stalfos here, then go through the door that opens to the right. Push the upper right block to open a door to the east and head through. Four Stalfos guard two unlit torches. Kill them and use your Ember Seeds to light the torches. Then step through the door to the north. 
Kill the blue Wallmasters here, then move to the upper left corner of the room. In the chest here, you'll find a Ring. Move to the north side of the room, then east. On this half, you'll encounter more Wallmasters. Kill them, then hack at the plants on the south edge of the room. Heal yourself with the fairies, then use the key on the Boss door to bring on the fight... 
Aquamentus is a huge, green dragon with a single horn. He has two attacks. A charge attack and a fireball attack. The fireballs spread out so you can easily dodge them, as long as you're not right on top of the boss when he shoots them. 
Aquamentus' second attack is a charge. When he is about to do this, he'll lower his head. This attack can be blocked by a Shield, but you are wiser to avoid it all together by maintaining your distance and stepping out of the way. 
The way to take down Aquamentus is to get up close to him and nail him in the horn with your Sword. Once you get close, whack him as many times as possible before he goes on the counterattack. Twenty hits or so should bring him down. When he dies, make sure to grab the Heart Container and the first Essence in the room to the east. 

Dungeon 1 Gnarled Root Dungeon - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The road to the first dungeon of Oracle of Seasons takes you to the Hero's Cave, The Maku Tree and finally to the Gnarled Root Dungeon, which is guarded by Aquamentis. 
You'll notice that the beginning of Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages are very similar. In Seasons, Link meets up with Din, the Oracle of Seasons (fancy that), at a camp just to the east of the starting point. Speak to each of her companions at the camp, then talk to Din herself and she'll ask you to dance. Boogie with her for awhile until the General of Darkness, Onox, steps in to ruin the party. He says a bunch of evil stuff, then grabs Din and spirits her away, sequestering the young beauty in the Temple of Seasons. This causes the seasons in the world to go all wacky-like. They're all scrambled, and you'll need to restore that power in order to set the world right. 
Impa, Din's attendant (and ulitmately an employee of Princess Zelda) tells you that she and Din were on their way to Hyrule.

Avoid the Keese and Gels in the next chamber, stepping on the floor switch on the right side of the room. A chest will drop from the ceiling. Inside is a Small Key. Once you have it, move through the previous room back to the chamber with the single block in it. Push it one space in any direction to open all of the doorways here, then leave through the southern one. 
In the next room, you'll see four blocks. You can't move them yet, so avoid the Keese and use your key on the locked door on the right. In the next room, you'll find a group of Gels. Avoid them and move to the upper left corner, stepping on the floor switch there. This will open a door on the north end of the room. Move around the channel in the floor and exit to the north. There is a dais in the next area with a chest atop it. Climb the stairs and open it to discover the Wooden Sword. 
Once you've got it, you will find yourself back outside the cave. If you need some healing, head to the cliff above the cave and enter this upper cavern entrance. You've found a fairy fountain! Return here whenever you're low for a full heal-job. If you want some more goodies, head back outside. Hack the plant on this ledge with your Sword, then hop down into the chute below. This will send you back inside Hero's Cave. Search the chest here for 30 Rupees. Then head back to the room with four blocks. Push the upper left block one space down to open a staircase in the lower right corner of the room. Go down the stairs to find a Gasha Seed. 
Once you have everything, leave the Hero's Cave and return to the village. Head to the east side of the village and climb the steps to the Maku Path, using you Sword to break down the gate. Follow the path north to talk to the Maku Tree. You find the old wooden geezer sleeping. Pop his spit bubble with your Sword and he'll wake up right quick. When you talk to him, the tree tells you how he dropped the ball in watching Din and where you might find Onox (duh duh duuh). But you'll need all eight essences. Then you can tell the old general to backdaheckup. He gives you a Gnarled Key and tells you to take it to the giant root near the lake to the north. 
This is a good time to explore town. Take a look at the Ring Shop on the south side of town and Vasu will walk you through how the Ring system works. Visit the Shop (to the east) and buy a Shield if you have the means. If you have any questions about how the game is played, go see the Know-It-All Birds in the northwest corner of town. 
Once you're done checking our Horon Village, head to the middle of town and take the path north, going past Impa's house. Keep going north until you see a bridge leading off to the west. Go across it to find the Gnarled Root. Use the Gnarled Key on it to access the very first dungeon. 
Head through the first room of the dungeon into a chamber with four blocks and a few plants. Hack the foliage to bring out some healing fairies. Push the upper right block one space in any direction to open all of the doors. Exit through the right door. In the next room, kill the Stalfos to bring a Small Key from the ceiling. Grab it and return to the previous room. Use the Key on the west door. 
In this next room, kill the Stalfos. This will do two things: open a door to the north and bring a chest down from the heavens. Look inside it to find the Dungeon Map. Then leave through the north door. Defeating the Gels here will reopen the door that slams shut behind you. Instead of leaving through the southern exit, get in the mine cart and ride it to the north. Ride it up and through the next room. You'll be deposited in a room with a pair of red Moblins. Slay them and push the block one space down, opening a door on the left wall. Trigger the pinching blades, then wait for them to retract and run through. 
Make your way through the block puzzle at the bottom of the room, then scale the short staircase in the northwest corner of the room. On a platform here, you'll find a chest containing a Gasha Seed. Gosh! A Seed! Hop off the platform here and return to the room with the mine cart. Instead of getting in it, climb the stairs just north of it and move to the right until you see a switch on the ground. Whack it once to change the tracks, then continue east until you find a chest. Inside is a Compass. Grab it, then return to the mine cart and get it. 
The cart will track through a couple of rooms. When you pop out of it, walk back to the left and search the chest for some Bombs. Grab them, then climb the steps above the mine cart. Move a little to the right and go down the set of stairs here. Follow the narrow path down, moving past a spinning blade. Curl up and around the corner, stepping on the floor switch here. This will drop a chest from the sky. Inside is a Small Key. Grab it, then loop around and climb the stairs again. Atop the platform, move to the left until you see an irregularity in the north wall. Place a bomb under it to open a passage in the wall. Weave through the maze in the following room, teasing the blades to bring them out and using the cubbies to duck into so you won't get hit. Make your way to the north side of the room. Here, you'll see a pair of plants. Cut them down to get a healing fairy. Exit to the north to find the mini-boss. 
The Goriya Brothers share a single boomerang which they really like to throw back and forth. The problem happens when you get in their way. Ultimately, if you can predict where the boomerang will go, these guys will be pretty easy to beat. 
Just dodge the whirling 'rang and slay the Brothers with your Sword. When they drop, you'll get a healing fairy and a portal back to the first room in the Dungeon. Grab the fairy and leave through the west door. 
In the following room, dodge the pinching blades that greet you at the door. Move all the way to the left side of the central diamond. Push the leftmost block one space up to gain access to the staircase inside. Go down the stairs to find yourself in a side-scrolling cave. Here, you'll find the Seed Satchel, which is full of Ember Seeds. 
Go back upstairs and return to the mini-boss room. Step through the portal to be taken back to the Gel room. Equip the Ember Seeds and drop one on each torch on the left wall to open the door here. Head through and defeat the boomerang-chucking Moblins. A chest will appear containing the Boss Key. Grab it and go back to the previous room, then exit to the south. Kill the Stalfos here, then go through the door that opens to the right. Push the upper right block to open a door to the east and head through. Four Stalfos guard two unlit torches. Kill them and use your Ember Seeds to light the torches. Then step through the door to the north. 
Kill the blue Wallmasters here, then move to the upper left corner of the room. In the chest here, you'll find a Ring. Move to the north side of the room, then east. On this half, you'll encounter more Wallmasters. Kill them, then hack at the plants on the south edge of the room. Heal yourself with the fairies, then use the key on the Boss door to bring on the fight... 
Aquamentus is a huge, green dragon with a single horn. He has two attacks. A charge attack and a fireball attack. The fireballs spread out so you can easily dodge them, as long as you're not right on top of the boss when he shoots them. 
Aquamentus' second attack is a charge. When he is about to do this, he'll lower his head. This attack can be blocked by a Shield, but you are wiser to avoid it all together by maintaining your distance and stepping out of the way. 
The way to take down Aquamentus is to get up close to him and nail him in the horn with your Sword. Once you get close, whack him as many times as possible before he goes on the counterattack. Twenty hits or so should bring him down. When he dies, make sure to grab the Heart Container and the first Essence in the room to the east.

To do this head back to the narrow bridge that connects Holodrum Plain to North Horon. Use your map to locate these regions if you're having problems. Just to the east of here, you will find a hole under a hollow log. Jump over the hole with the Feather and head through the log.

Dungeon 5: Unicorn's Cave may sound like a pleasant experience, but it is most certainly not. 
Dungeon 6 Ancient Ruins - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Before heading to the Ancient Ruins, you should stock up on cool stuff first, like the Iron Shield. You can also go on a Treasure Hunt. 
There are a few things to do before you head off to your new quest. First off, you can now complete the Trading Items quest, as detailed in the Items section of this guide. 
Once you get the Power of Autumn, change the season to Autumn and go back to Eyeglass Island. You'll now be able to get over to the chest there and claim a rare Gasha Seed. 
Another thing to do is to go get yourself a brand new Shield. Head to the big furnace. South of it is a stream of lava. Leap across, then head to the left. On the left side of the screen is a platform with a chest atop it. Use the magnetic block in the lower corner to traverse the four holes in the path, then step into the cave. Continue up the stairs to find the chest above. Inside is the Red Ore. 
Go north to another S magnet block. Use it to repel across to the left, then head all the way west until you reach the Market. Grab the Member's Card from the bottom of the row of goods. It'll cost you 5 Ore Chunks. Now when you go back to Horon Village, you'll be able to get the Treasure Map. While you're at the Market, get the Silver Seed from the top of this row. 
Return outside. Now go up to Mt. Cucco and head through the portal atop the mountain. Once you get below ground, head north until you see a pair of holes near a blue Subrosian. Leap over the holes and make your way along the lava coast to the west. When you get a chance to go south, do so, reaching a clearing stuffed with holes and magnetic blocks. Use your Gloves to get over the first series of holes, then keep heading right until you reach a chest. It contains the Blue Ore. If you keep going and work your way to the lower left corner, you'll discover an orange square of soil. Dig it up to get a Ring. 
Once you get the Blue Ore, head to the east of Subrosia and find the big furnace. Go inside and head to the Subrosian wearing the dew rag. Give him the Red and Blue Ore and they'll make Hard Ore out of it. Take the Hard Ore north of the Market, then west to the Subrosian Smithy (he's the guy in the cave with a bunch of Shovels behind him). Select "Do Whatever" and the Smithy will turn your Wooden Shield into an Iron Shield. 
Head back to Horon Village and go to the Shop. Now that you have the Member's Card, you can get into the secret room in the Shop. Head down there to find all new wares for sale: a bigger Seed Satchel, a Gasha Seed or a Treasure Map. Grab the Treasure Map. Now when you look at your Map Screen, treasures will sparkle. Grab the Satchel while you're here. 
Take a look at the map and check out where the treasures are placed. To get the first one, head to the west of Horon Village and exit the town. On the next path, hop off the notch here down to the beach. On the edge of the water is an unlit torch. Light it with the Ember Seed to extend a pier to a small island to the south. Head over and drop a Mystery Seed on the question mark formation, then kill the Moldorm that appears and a chest will materialize. Inside is the X-Shaped Jewel. 
For the next item, warp to Spool Swamp. Use the stump in the swamp to change the season to Winter. Move down through the gnarly, frozen over swamp until you reach the narrow passage that you used Ricky to get through. Call him with your flute and use him to get to the south end of the screen, then move east. Watch out for the Pincers that spring at you from out of the ground. Ricky will crush the small mounds of snow near these holes. Move all the way to the right, then head up to the blocked in cave here. One punch from Ricky will open it. Hop off of him and go into the cave. In the chest here is the Square Jewel. 
To get the next Jewel, warp to North Horon and make your way to the Gnarled Root Dungeon entrance. Go south from here and get into the water, then swim left, then down to find a cave entrance. Inside, you'll find a chest with the Round Jewel inside. 
For the final Jewel, return to the area in front of the Dancing Dragon Dungeon. Jump into the water and swim to the upper right corner. Dive here to take you to a subterranean cave filled with water. In the upper right corner of the cave is the Pyramid Jewel. 
Once you have all of the Jewels, warp to Spool Swamp. Head to the right to find a sign that points the way to Tarm Ruins. Go north from the sign, through the hollow log. Go near the symbols on the wall to the north and your jewels will be placed into the wall. Once the gate opens, head north and get on the stump. Make sure the season is Summer, then climb the vine on the cliff face. Kill the Soldiers here, then move to the west. Climb down the vine here, then move to the Armos Statue in the small field. Push it one space up to make a staircase in the cliff wall to the north. Return up the vine and head to the east, then head back down the first vine. 
On the stump here, change the season to the Winter, then go through the space you've made to the left. Climb the stairs next to the Armos Statue, then pop down on to the snowdrift to the left. This will allow you to climb the stairs you recently made. There's a stump here. Don't get on it yet. Instead, push the bottom Armos Statue on to the ice. Then change the season to Autumn and the statue will fall into the pond, allowing you to get through. Go all the way to the east and move the mushrooms guarding the hole in the ground here. There is a Deku Scrub here. He'll try to attack you, but Shield yourself from his attacks and he'll help you. He'll tell you how to avoid getting lost in the forest: "travel west, then south, east and north, taking each step in a warmer season." 
Once you're done with the Scrub, go back to the stump and turn the season to Winter. This will allow you to get over the frozen pond and follow the north path. Get on the stump and revert to Autumn, then move the mushrooms in the path and head to the left. Kill the Like Likes in the next field, then blow up the blocked-in passage on the cliff face. Step inside for a full healing makeover. Then move all the way to the south, until you see a small tree in the path. This is where you go to get the final trading item, as discussed in the Items section of this guide. 
Once you get the Noble Sword, go west, then north to the stump. Step on top of it and change the season to Winter, then head west. Get back on the stump and change the season to Autumn, then go south. Get back on the stump and change the season to Spring, then go east. Then pop on the stump and change the season to Summer, finally moving north. You'll reach a field of Armos Statues. Keep heading north and climb the stairs, up to another Mystical Tree. Go to the east from here and change the season to Autumn. Go back to the west and move the mushrooms here, then torch the small tree. Follow the stairs down to find a chest. Inside is a Gasha Seed. 
Go back to the right and get on the stump, changing the season to Winter. When it's cold, go south, then head to the right. Burn the row of trees here, then head north until you reach a path through the snow mound. Once you get atop it, head up the stairs, then to the left. You'll reach a small stump blocking a bridge to the west. Since you can't get past it, move the bottom of the two Armos Statues to the right, exposing a notch in the cliff. Jump down from here into the valley below. Get on the stump and change the season back to Spring, then hop on the Spring Flower to catapult up to the ridge above. Follow the bridge across to the entrance to the Dungeon. You will be confronted by Twinrova, who will cackle and get spooky, then disappear. Head into the Dungeon. 
In the first room head north to a narrow hallway with a locked block to the left. Go up the stairs ahead and exit through the north passage. You'll find yourself in a room with a large turnstile at its center. Step on it and it will take you to the east path. Continue east to the next room. Kill the Snakeropes here and exit to the east, bypassing the locked door to the north (for now). Equip your Feather as you step into the next chamber. Hop over one of the pinching blades that greet you at the door, then move around the pit that blocks your path. On the far right side of the room is a chest that contains a measly 5 Rupees. Grab them if you want, then exit to the south. 
In the next room, slay the Snakeropes. Place a Bomb in the middle of the south wall to open a secret room stocked full of Rupees. Go back to the previous room, then go west through two chambers. You'll reemerge in the second room of the Dungeon. Climb the right set of stairs here, then return to the turnstile. When you step on it this time, you'll go to the western side of the room. Head down the passage here to another room full of Gibdos. Kill them, then go through the north exit. 
In the next room, a Spark scoots around the perimeter and a Hradhat Beetle greets you at the door. Beat the Beetle into the pit, then take down the Spark with the Boomerang. Go into the block maze and use the Magnetic Gloves to grab and drag the ball to the edge of the maze (right next to the pit). Use the Feather to hop over the channel to the north, then use the Gloves to push the ball across the pit into the lower half of the room. From there, drag the ball to the right side of the room, below the pit. Push it across the pit above, then drag it all the way to the right. Finally, drag it down on to the floor switch on the right wall. This will cause a Small Key to fall from the sky. Grab it. 
Go back to the previous room and head through the south exit. In the next room, kill all the Snakeropes, then mount the stairs to the west and follow the narrow path up to a chest, which contains the Dungeon Map. Once you have it, go back down into the room. As long as all of the Snakeropes are dead the block here will move, opening the door to the right. You'll be back in the hallway room, just north of the entrance to the Dungeon. Use your Magnetic Gloves to pull the magnet ball off of its perch on the ledge to the north, then finagle it on to the floor switch in the lower right corner. This will keep the door to the left open. Now that that's done, unlock the block to the right to enter the hallway. Now head up to the turnstile and go through it until you're heading north. 
In this room, slay the Spark with a Boomerang toss and the Snakeropes with your Sword. Then use your Magnetic Gloves to pull the magnet ball from the right to the left, coming to rest on the floor switch there. This will open a staircase in the upper left corner of the room. Go up it to the second floor. 
When you get upstairs, note the pit in the bottom left corner of the room. Falling through it will take you to the room below. Use your Feather to hop across the patches of spikes in the floor, then use your Sword to bust up the rocks in the path as you work your way through the maze. Beware of the spinning blades. Once you make it to the east side of the room, exit south. Use your Shield/Sword combo on the spiny Beetles in the next room, then search the chest on the left wall to find a Small Key. Go back to the first floor and head through the turnstile, turning it yellow. Maneuver through the rooms until you can ride the turnstile to the east path (this will require running through the western rooms twice). 
In the room to the east (the one full of Snakeropes) is a locked door. Unlock it and step through to a room filled with danger. You'll need to dodge the blasts from the laser turret at the center of the room while riding a couple tiny platforms up to treasure. To do this, step on the platform that is moving vertically just to the left of the laser turret. This will take you up to another platform that is moving left and right into the northwest corner. Get on it and ride it to the chest, which contains the Compass. Then return to the ground near the door and ride the platform here to the east. Step off and go to the next room. 
Make your way to the northeast corner of the next room, and be sure to clear out all the Keese here. In the corner, you'll find a floor switch. Before stepping on it, equip your Pegasus Seeds and get ready to book. Step on the switch and drop a Seed, then move down and go on the path directly under the switch, making your way to the extended walkway in the upper left corner. Cross the walkway to get to the last part of the laser turret room. Here, you'll find an up staircase. Mount the stairs. 
In the room above, slay the Gibdos and grab the Bombs out of the chest. Then place a Bomb on the cracked portion of wall to the south. Once the passage is opened, move through. In the following chamber, you will see a group of Armos Statues in the center of the room. In between them is a chest containing 5 Rupees. If you don't touch them, they won't wake up. Leave them alone, grab the loot and head to the west. This will take you to the bottom half of the spiny Beetle room you've been in before. Push the tramp here all the way to the right, on to the purple floor tile. Then jump on the trampoline to get to the room above. Once there, head through the south door. 
In the next room, dodge the mace-wielding Soldier and duck into the room to the right. Go to the right side of the chamber and search the chest here to find the Magical Boomerang. This sucker has a much wider arch than its lesser counterpart, and can also be steered once thrown. Once you get the 'rang, the Armos Statues come to life. Put them down with a series of Bombs, then go back to the previous room. In the lower left corner, smash the crystal rocks and step into the pit to return two floors below. Use the magnet ball to depress the floor switch, opening the door to the left. Go back through the Snakerope room and climb the stairs on the left side of the chamber. Move up the platform and leave through the left door. 
In the next room, open the chest in the northeast corner to find 10 Rupees. Then turn your attention to the block labyrinth to the left. Make your way through the maze to the bottom left corner, avoiding the spinning blades. Step on the floor switch here, then cruise back to the north end of the room and exit. 
In the next room, it's time to put that Magical Boomerang through its paces. Stand to the right of the low wall in the northwest corner. Throw the 'Rang and steer it into the crystal ball here, opening a staircase to the north. Go up it into a room full of Gibdos. Move through the east exit. Here, you'll encounter a pair of fast-swirling blades. Use your Feather to leap over them as you move to the upper right corner of the room. Step on the floor switch here and a bunch of Snakeropes will fall from the sky. Polish them off with your Sword, then go through the exit to the south. 
Kill the Stalfos here, then head to the left in this huge room. As you move left, dodge the spear shooters in the wall, making your way to the small niche to the left next to the large pit. Here, you'll see a crystal ball tracking back and forth. Use your Magical Boomerang to hit it, changing it to red. This will open the south doorway. Go through it. As you step into the next room, move to the left side to the pit in the floor. Fall through to the room below. 
Here you will find a trampoline tucked in the corner. This can be used to return to the floor above. Kill the Spiny and Hardhat Beetles, then move to the south end of the room. Uproot the vases here to get health and other goodies, then move to the right side of the room. Get on the platform and shoot each of the five torches with Ember Seeds in order to open a staircase at the north end of the room. 
Go up the stairs and immediately exit to the right to find yourself in a room full of Keese and Armos Statues. There is a huge Rupee gem just to the right of the entrance. Once you grab it, you'll have to move quickly, as the walls will start closing in. Equip your Feather and Pegasus Seeds in order to get through unscathed. The general idea is to move as quickly as possible all the way to the right, then turn the corner and trek all the way back. To do it in time, use the Pegasus Seeds and leap over the lines of spikes with the Feather. Eventually, you'll exit to the left. On top of a small altar here is a chest containing the Boss Key. Once you have it, head back through the door to the right and scoot up the stairs in the lower left corner here. 
Once upstairs, kill the Stalfos in the room, then push the upper left block one space in any direction and the door to the north will open. In the next room, slay the onslaught of Snakeropes, then move to the upper right corner of the room and drop through the floor. There is often a fairy contained in the vase near the wall, so get that first. Once below, follow the path down a chest. It contains a Small Key. Go back to the nearby trampoline and bounce to the room above. Use the Small Key on the locked door here to meet Vire. 
Vire's chamber is completely lined in spikes, so you'll have to step lively in order to beat him. Vire is the lapdog of Onox, but he definitely isn't a chip off the old baddie. He has several fireball attacks, but they are easily deflected by swatting your Sword. 
The main thing about this fight is staying in the center of the arena. Vire will come in for a piece of you every once in a while, but if you just keep a-swinging, you'll take him down easily. Just keep that Sword slashing and Vire will be toast. When he is, you'll get the fairy and portal, as per usual. 
When the battle is over, go out the eastern door. In the next room, you'll encounter a row of pinching blades and wall spears. Equip your Feather and run to the right, leaping over the blades as they collapse on you. Keep moving to the east, hopping over the rolling, metal logs. Once you reach the other side of the room, go to the upper right corner and step on the floor switch. This will open the door to the south. Go through. 
In this room are a pair of floor switches. Step on one and a group of Snakeropes will fall from the sky. Step on the other and a flight of stairs will appear in the lower right corner of the room. Go up to a room with several Wallmaster. Kill them, then move through the slanted rows of blocks and exit to the north. You'll find yourself in a room with a pair of Hardhat Beetles. Run around them to get them into a clump, then mount the stairs to the north. Use your Magnetic Gloves to latch on to the magnet ball here, then position yourself above the Beetles and jump down with the ball in tow. If it lands on top of them, they will die, opening a passage to the left. 
Go through the door into a room with a couple of Soldiers and a Wizzrobe in it. Kill them and move to the lower left. Here is a low wall under a series of three moving crystal balls. Use your Magical Boomerang to hit all three. When they're all red, exit through the door that opens to the south. Climb the stairs into the higher part of the room, then kill the Shrouded Stalfos here. Push the trampoline down against the south wall, then to the right so that it's even with the eastern staircase. Then pop up to the room above. Use your Rang on the crystal ball to the north. Then fall through the floor. You've made a staircase appear downstairs. Climb up it, then push the single block above the field of purple tiles. Then move up to the Boss Door. 
Manhandla is pretty tough to beat. Sure, he's just a plant, but he's got four heads and take a while to drop. Each of the four heads is repeatedly spitting fireballs at you, so you'll have to move around quite a bit in order to stay alive. 
To take on Manhandla, you'll need your Feather and Magical Boomerang equipped. The Feather is to jump over the fireballs as you race around the arena. The Boomerang is to get at each of Manhandla's four venus-fly trap style noggins. You can only hurt them when their mouths are open, and often that means you'll have to nail the ones on the opposite side from where you are standing. The easiest way to do this is to stay near the bottom of the room, throwing you 'Rang directly up, next to the boss. When the Boomerang is at its furthest point, step under Manhandla, and the Boomerang will come back to you through his body, injuring him in the process. 
The most important thing to keep in mind is to stay on the move. Don't worry about attacking... that will eventually take care of itself, as long as you keep sending your Boomerang out. When you've toppled all four of the plant's heads, he will turn into stem form only. When this happens, hit him repeatedly with your Boomerang at close range. Eventually, he will shrivel, exposing a central heart. Use your Wooden Sword to destroy that and win the battle. One swing will do. 
Once you beat Manhandla, go grab the Essence and Heart Container. Then listen to the Maku. He hears an essence in a cemetary to the west of Horon Village.

Dungeon 7 Explorer's Crypt - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Explorer's Crypt is only reachable via Pirate Ship. It's very easy to get stuck in this part of the game, so read on carefully! 
To get around the sea, you'll have to undercut it by going to Subrosia. Head to the southwest corner to the cemetery. Here, you will notice a Pirate standing near a portal. Go in the building below him. Inside, talk to the Captain. He's looking for a Bell. Go upstairs and talk to the Pirates here. One of them will freak out and start bumping into the drawers of a chest. Remember this pattern: you'll need it to open the path to the desert. Go up the set of stairs here and take the portal out of Subrosia. You'll arrive in a cave above. Flip the nearby swicth to extend the bridge around the room, then follow it to the door. You'll out in the south end of Horon Village. 
Head out of Horon Village to the east. Just as you leave, there is a hollow log to the south. Go through it to the beach. Move to the east until you come to the gates of the desert. Talk to the skeleton here and he'll take off, allowing you to be alone to work your magic on the gate. Push the second door from the right twice, then push the second one from the left once, then the first one (on the left) twice.and the rightmost one three times. This will cause the gate to open. 
In the desert, watch out for cacti (they hurt you if you touch them), quicksand and the Leevers. There are also moving cacti called Pokeys here. Head to the right one screen, then go south and fall into the quicksand pit here. In the cave that you fall into, walk to the single square of deep water and dive. Swim all the way to the right, taking down Cheep Cheeps as you go. Surface into a tiny cave, then search the chest on the platform above to find a nifty Ring. Once you have it, hop down from the ledge. Find the ship buried in the sand to the northwest. Enter the door here to meet a pirate's ghost. To help him get to the afterlife, you'll need to find his skull. 
Move to the upper right corner of the desert. There, you'll find the skull in a small oasis. If you put a Bomb on the wall to the north, you'll open an entrance into the fairy fountain. Use the Bracelet to grab the skull and take it around the desert. Go near the center of each whirlpool, but don't fall in. When you reach the pit with the Bell in it, the skull will start yappin'. Drop into that pool, and you'll fall below, getting the Rusty Bell. 
Note: If you drop the skull, just return to the oasis to get it back. 
Return to the buried ship and push the yellow table one space up, allowing you to get to the top half of the room. Follow the stairs back up to Subrosia. 
Once you get back to Subrosia, head to the Smithy. Choose the "Do It!" option to get the Smithy to polish the Bell, and he'll spitshine that sucker. Once it's been transmogrified into the Pirate's Bell, return to the Pirate Captain near Subrosia Cemetery. The ship gets repaired, so get inside it and ride it to new lands. 
Once the Pirate Ship lands, you'll have an opportunity to get an easily overlooked Ring. Get off the ship to the left and move up and around the ship's bow to the beach. Follow the beach to the right until you find a Ring in a chest. Once you've got that, move to the north. Here, you'll discover a small building. Go inside and search the chest for some Bombs. Then pop over the pit to the right and lay a Bomb next to the cracked wall. This will open a passage to the east, leading to a stump. Step on it and change the season to Summer. Then return to the ship and head all the way to the west. Climb the vine here up to the cemetery. Move to the north and climb up the stairs to the next Dungeon. 
Head north from the opening room of the Dungeon. The next room has a locked door to the right. Head left, following the path up to a northern exit. (There is a blue owl here as well, who tells you that "The source of the curse is hidden in darkness.") The next room is completely dark. You can't do anything here yet, so proceed through to the next room to the north. 
As you step inside the room to the north, something tells you to "begone before the fires go out, or else..." As the lights dim, make your way quickly to the east and exit. Here, you'll find a bunch of Wizzrobes. Slay them as they appear. A chest will drop down in the center of the room. Inside is a Small Key. Grab it and head back to the second room. 
Unlock the door to the east and step through. Slay the Stalfos here and climb the right set of stairs up to another chest. Inside is a Ring. Then climb the stairs to the left and follow the path up to the darkened room above. Equip your Slingshot with Ember Seeds. Launch one at each of the torches. This will bring out a Poe named Amy. Leap down into the room and dodge the ghost, then nail her with your Sword as they go by. After about five solid whacks, Amy will leave and the room will stay lit. 
Head through the room to the north. The curse is lifted, so this room will stay lit as well. Use a Bomb on the cracked piece of wall to the left. Then move through and search the chest in the next room. Inside is the Compass. Once you have it, go back to the previous room and use the Bracelet to push the long weights on the right side of the room out of the way so you can access the stairs. Go down the staircase. Once you're downstairs, you'll be surrounded by Armos Statues. Leave this room, heading to the left. 
In the following room, step on the floor switch up on the right to bring a trampoline down from the ceiling. Once it falls, situate it three spaces down and one space to the left of the blue tile at the north end of the room. Then pop up to the room above, pushing up to land on the floor switch in the center of the pit. This will drop a Key down into the room below. 
Return to the Armos Statue room. Touch each of the Statues to bring them to life, then slay them with the Magical Boomerang. All but one can be killed. The last one should be pushed on to the floor switch. This will open the door to the south. Once there, slay the Stalfos here, then proceed to the staircase at the end of the long conveyor belt (on the right side of the room). In the next area, you'll need to ride a quick-moving platform through a maze of blocks over a pit. Then you'll need to use your Magnetic Gloves to propel yourself over to a far left ledge. Before getting on the platform, slay all the Keese you can with the 'Rang. Then jump on the platform and ride it through. When you reach the left side of the room, repel to the left platform and exit to the north. 
As you enter the next room, you'll note a bridge to the north. This will start to "throw itself" at you if you linger too long. Don't linger. Instead, book across the bridge. At the top of the room, head to the left into the next room. There are a ton of Armos Statues and four floor switches here. First, step on the lower western switch, then the left southern switch. Then step on the upper western switch, then finally on the right southern switch. A Key will drop down in the center of the Statues. Grab it and head back to the conveyor room. Head through the south door, unlocking it with the Small Key you just got. 
There is a trampoline trapped in a circle of blocks here. To get to it, push the block below the upper left torch in, then push the block above the lower left torch in one space. Push the middle block up one space and use the Feather to leap over the tramp to the right. Push the trampoline three space to the left, and one space up. When you arrive above, push down on the D-Pad to reach solid ground. You're inside the block enclosure on the first floor. Head to the left and kill the Stalfos and Spark. Search the chest for the Dungeon Map. Then return to the trampoline room below. From here, head to the east through the locked door. 
You'll enter a darkened chamber. Use the Pegasus Seeds to move quickly, then equip and use the Ember Seeds in the Slingshot to light all four torches in this room. This will bring Margaret out from hiding. The drill is the same. Whack her a bunch of times with your Sword and she'll go away, lifting the curse on the room to the left. Move through the previous room and exit to the left. 
In this chamber, you'll encounter a pair of large, iron bars moving over the surface of a pool. Dive in the water and move through, making sure to dive when the bars approach in order to avoid damage. Make your way to the upper right corner of the room, where there is a staircase. Go down the stairs. You'll see a lock block and pit to the right. Ignore them for now and go left. 
The next room is separated by a wide chasm. There are Knights on patrol on either side of the gap. Kill the one near you, then equip the Glove and use it to pull them over the blackness and drop them to their doom. When the other two Knights die, a bridge will extend. Hit the switcher ball, causing the magnets in this area to rotate. Then cross the bridge and go into the room above. 
Here, you'll find a series of rotating magnets. Use the glove to attract yourself to the one above, then hold the button to rotate around it until you reach the small platform to the right. Once you get there, use Pegasus Seeds and the Feather to get to the upper right platform, and then the platform near the top of the room. Go to the far left side of this and look at the magnet below. Attract yourself to it and ride it as it rotates around, then repel to the left until you are under the next magnet. Then quickly switch polarity and attract yourself to the next magnet. You'll have to switch to the up position quickly in order to do this. Once you're in rotation on the final magnet to the left, ride it around until you can repel yourself down to the platform below. 
Use the blue trampoline nearby to propel yourself up into the room above (push right while in the air). Kill the Stalfos here to open the door to the north, then fall back down through the hole. Then hop on the red tramp and you'll be taken up two levels, into a room with several Sparks and a spiked floor. Use the Boomerang to kill the Sparks, then equip the Feather and jump over the spikes, making your way to the upper left corner of the room. Drop through the pit here, then go through the door. 
The next room has a chest on a lonely spiked platform in the center of the room. Use the Boomerang to eliminate all of the Keese here then hop on the green platform that is quickly circling the center island. It's tough to jump on this thing, but if you take off just as the platform is rounding the southeast corner, you should be fine. Then hop to the clear space in front of the chest. Inside the chest, you'll find Roc's Cape. This will enable you to double jump when equipped. 
Go back to the previous room and push the trampoline one space up. Hop up to the room above, then make your way back through the spikes and fall through the floor. Make your way back to the room with the blocked-in tramp, and exit north. In the next room, get on the conveyor belt to the east and go down the staircase here. The next room is filled with Keese. Kill them all, then get on the fast-moving platform just to the south. This will zip you around the room. Use your Roc's Cape at the end of the line to hop over the two-space chasm to solid ground. Exit to the north. 
In the next room, equip your Pegasus Seeds and keep your Roc's Cape. There is a fly-away bridge to the north and you'll have to cross it quickly. Then move to the area to the east. Use your Cape to traverse the two medium-sized pits here. In the next room, use the Glove to pull the Polarities toward you, then slay them with the Sword. This will bring a trampoline tumbling from the ceiling. Push it three spaces to the north, then hop on it and press slightly up. You will land on a moving platform in the room above. Ride it to the edge of the platform and go up the stairs. Go to the west side of the room and pull it over to the left side of the track here, and while still attracting the ball, hop down to the area below. Then drag the ball over to the floor switch and a chest will appear. Grab the Small Key from inside it. 
Once you have it, head to the left and use the Knights to re-open the door to the south. Return through the conveyor belt room and make your way back to the room with the lock block. Use the Small Key on it to expose an area full of crumbled pieces of floor above a large pit. Use the Roc's Cape to jump between platforms, working to the right side of the room. From here, head to the bottom of the room, sure not to stand on any crumbled tile for an extended period of time. Work your way across the room until you reach the green platform to the left. Get on it and ride it down to the edge of the floor, then hop off. Exit south. 
The next area is a huge corridor which encircles a gigantic room. Move all the way around it until you reach a ledge that overlooks a pit swimming with Moldorms. Use the Bombs to take them down, then drop into the room below and make haste across the cracked floor to the southern exit. Move to the bottom of this long, narrow platform and use Pegasus Seeds and Roc's Cape to get over to the platform to the right. Step on the floor switch here to open a door in the lower right corner of the square outdoor corridor. Go to the nearby stairs, push the block out of your way and go to the now-open door. Head through. Time for a Mini-Boss fight. 
The pesky ghosts are back again, and this time, it's personal. This fight is all about keeping the homefire burning. If all of the torches get blown out at any time, you will be placed back in the first room of the dungeon. And who wants that? The object here is to stand near the two torches to the left. Margaret and Amy will try to blow them out. Keep your Slingshot loaded with Ember Seeds and relight the torch whenever it's snuffed. Whenever the ghosts appear, slash at them with your sword. It will take a good deal of whacking to lay these spooks low, but when you do, you'll get a portal and a fairy. Woo-hoo! 
Once the mini-boss battle concludes, go through the door on the right side of the room. The next area is full of Wizzrobes and stairways. This is actually a maze through two rooms: one above and the one you're on. A good rule of thumb is to always go up the staircase furthest to the east. Once you get all the way to the right in the last room, you will see a set of stairs to the north and one to the south. The south stairs go to the Boss fight. The north stairs are what you need. Exit to the north. 
In the next area, you'll have to use your magnet powers to get over yet another precarious chasm. Use the Glove to attract over to the first magnet to the left. Hold on until you're on the left side of the magnet, then propel yourself all the way over the gap until you come to rest against the block here. Quickly switch polarity and point down to attract to the magnet below. Ride it around until you are on the top of this magnet, then propel yourself back to the cracked blocks in the upper left corner. Don't stand on a cracked block for too long. Instead, scoot around until you come to the southernmost tip, then use Roc's cape to get to the single space of ground below. Leap to the moving green platform, then ride it to the left and double jump to solid ground in the corridor to the north. Follow it up and out of this area. 
In the next room, you'll encounter more Wizzrobes and Stalfos. Jump between the platforms with Roc's Cape and slay everything in the area. When you do, a Key will drop from the sky. Grab it and head back to the previous room. Ride the little green platform to the right, then double-jump to the narrow corridor here. Go to the end of this seemingly dead end and push the north block up to clear a path into the room. Exit to the north. 
Here, you'll find the locked door that the Small Key you just got will open. Go through it. Hop over the little gap to the north, then continue up the path until you find a set of stairs leading to a large pool. Swim south until you are looking over three rows of blocks with floor switches at the end. You'll need to jump to each floor switch in order of the number of blocks in the row. Jump to the bottom one first, then the top one, then the middle one, using Pegasus Seeds and Roc's Cape, of course. When you do it successfully, a jumping lane will open on the platform to the right. Move up the stairs in the lower right corner and follow the path all the way to the north, tripping a final floor switch. This will bring down a trampoline at the center of the water room. 
Drop into the water room and pop on to the tramp. It will take you up two levels. When you reach the second level, push down to land on a moving green platform. Once on the platform, shoot a Mystery Seed at the blue owl. He will say "Below me red. My right, red. Only I shall shine blue." Get off on the right side of the room.and take the stairs down. Here you will see a pair of switch balls. Make sure both are red, then go back upstairs. 
Get back on the green platform and go to the left side of the room, then go down the stairs. Here, make the upper ball blue and the lower one red. This will open a door to the north. Use the Cape to double-jump up to that doorway. In the next room, kill the hopping Stalfos and watch out for the torches, which will spit fireballs at you. when all the Stalfos drop, you'll get a chest containing the Boss Key. Head back to the crazy Wizzrobe and stairs room, and this time take the southern staircase to get to the Boss door. 
Gleeok is a crazy two-headed dragon that spits flames at you non-stop once you enter the room. To combat him, equip your Sword and Cape. Immediately after you enter the room, jump and glide, because there are fireballs headed your way. Work up to the two heads of the dragon. Each time one of the heads rears back for a fire spit, leap and float to avoid the attack. Then land and start slashing at the two heads. Hit both of them at once as much as possible. 
Eventually, one head will come off and start zipping around the room. At this point, move in and start hitting the one that's still attached with everything you've got. The object is to knock both of them off at the same time. If you can't get the other one to drop before the first one comes back, you'll have to do it all over again. Don't let this happen. 
When both heads detach, you'll be faced with a new challenge. Now the dragon's body will leap up into the air, and when it lands with a thud, it will knock you off your feet. When you're down, the body will try to steamroll you, which does a lot of damage. To avoid the thud, leap and float before impact. Then run in before Gleeok jumps again and slash him with your sword. Eventually he'll die, leaving you with the next Essence: Seed of Life.

Dungeon 8 Sword and Shield Maze - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Sword and Shield Maze can only be reached via the Temple in Subrosia. 
As you exit the dungeon, the Maku Tree tells you that the final Essence is completely up to you. Head up to the Temple Remains (check your map for location--it's above Holodrum Plain). As you go through the hollow log to the west, make sure you have the Slingshot loaded with Pegasus Seeds. Launch them at the Knights here, then kill them with your sword. Head north from this spot and slay the morning star warrior here. Then equip Roc's Cape and jump over the holes in the path. Continue to the right. 
Kill the guards at the steps of the Temple and then go in. Move east and kill the Tektites, then get on the stump and change the season to to Autumn. Go to the left (under the swirling portal), continuing west until you reach a series of three plants in the path (just as it turns north). Chop them down and proceed, moving to a series of holes that are covered over by leaves. Use the Pegasus Seeds to haul butt across these and proceed up the Temple steps. Move south, staying inside the Temple, until you see a stump. Hop on it and change the season to Winter. Head back up the steps, then go right, leaping over the holes in the path. Walk over the ice block here, then south. Here, you'll find a portal to Subrosia. 
Back in Subrosia. Once you get to the land down under, take a hike up the stairs to the north.You see a crazy Subrosian chucking everything he can into a lava hole. Throw a bomb in there yourself and you'll shake the Temple to its very foundations! Lava will rain all over the Temple. Head back to the portal and back to the Temple. 
When you emerge from the portal, head north and look at the purple way ahead. Place a Bomb near the filled-in door, then stand back. Then step inside to find yourself in a large, lava-rich cave. Use your Cape to hop between platforms. At the north end of the cave, you'll find a Heart Piece. Exit the cave and head to the east, sticking to the purple wall. Then move south to the tree stump. Change the season to Summer, then head east and go to the vine that scales the wall. 
Use your Cape to jump over the lava to sandy bits of safe ground. Your goal is the northern cave entrance. Once inside, equip your Glove and line yourself up just to the left of the door, pointed through the craggy gap to the north. There is a magnet on the other side of this gap. Activate the Glove to pull yourself across. Then move east until you can't move any further. Point down and use the Glove again to get across a similar gap. Then hurry to the stairs. 
In the next area, move the green shells that block your path, watching out for the Keese that pepper the cave sky. When you exit up the stairs, you will find yourself atop the Temple. Slay the guards here, then move left. Go down the staircase. Back in the cave, you'll have to battle Gels, Moldorms and Keese as you make your way to the upper left corner. Be careful for weak ground as you walk. Take the stairs up here. Follow the path to another entrance. Inside, you find healing fairies and a portal. Go into the portal to be taken to Subrosia again. Once there, keep heading north to get to the Sword & Shield Dungeon. 
In the first room of the dungeon, exit to the north. You'll be in a room full of Wizzrobes, but run through it to the east. Here, you'll find a room with an eye block at the end of a narrow corridor. Use your Slingshot ot wing a Mystery Seed at it, and the pupil will come to life, dropping a key on the yellow space on the right side of the room. Move the vases below it to claim the Key.   
Go back to the Wizzrobe room and exit to the north. In the next area, you'll see a couple of dormant eye blocks. You can't get to them until you get the Super Slingshot, so just head north on the narrow path and exit. The next room sports a trio of Polarities. Kill them to open a door to the north. 
The next room is covered in ice. Kill the Gels and avoid the Hardhat Beetle, then use a Bomb on the cracked blocks to the north. This will allow you to get at the magnet ball up here. Drag it into the room and over the Hardhat Beetle to smite him. When he croaks, grab the Key that falls and exit to the east. 
Get your Boomerang out and start nailing the Sparks in the next room. Each time you kill one, another health fairy will appear, so it isn't really all that bad in the end. Once the threat has been eliminated move over the ice to the next eastern area. Here, you'll find a lock block which you should open with the Small Key. This will allow you access to the stairs. 
You're in the basement. Drop a Scent Seed at your feet and the Sankeropes in the room will fall into the pits trying to get to it. Pick your way through the walkway here, carefully avoiding Keese and moving vases until you reach the exit in the lower left corner. In the next room, don't linger too long in any one place or a Wallmaster will appear and deposit in the first room of the dungeon. Use Roc's Cape to hop over thr rolling bars as you move to the bottom right corner of the room. Take the stairs down. 
Here, you'll find yourself in a side-scrolling cave. Double jump past the circling fire to the platform here, then double-jump again to go further to the left. Same drill in the next room, except that this time, the platform is moving up and down and there are large lava balls flying up at you. Once you reach the opposite side of the cave, scale the ladder and exit. 
In the following room, kill the Gels, then use the Cape to hop over the rolling bar and make your way across the lava. Take your time making the right jumps. Only use the double jump to avoid the bar, and you'll be much better off. Exit to the south. 
In the next room, dodge the Fire Keese and Blades as you make your way to the right side of the room. There you'll find a floor switch which will open the door in the lower right corner. Go through. In the following chamber, you'll run into some nasty Polarities and Gels. Either kill them or dart up the stairs in the upper left corner. 
The next room is gnarly. You're on an ice rink lined with spikes. To make matters worse, Spiked Beetles will try to punch you into the pain. Make short movements and take your time as you move to the right. Open the chest here to find the Compass. Then return to the previous room. Use the Small Key on the door to the right and go through. 
You'll find yourself in a large turnstile room. Step into the central dial and it will deposit you in the north path. Go up it, then follow the path to the left, ending up back in the previous room. Drop down to the room below and go through the door to the right again. Back in the turnstile room, head through the dial again to be taken to the south path. 
In the next chamber, you'll have to battle Keese, Gels and soem Wizzrobes. When you've sorted them all, go drop a Mystery Seed on the blue owl. He'll mumble something about a watch, so ignore him. Go out the door on the right wall. There is a morning-star wielding guard in the next room. Bomb him, then jump over the stripe of lava and head up the stairs.  
When you get upstairs, you'll be hemmed in by a magnet ball. Push it forward slightly, just enough so you can get above it. Push it down into the alley below. Then, staying in line with the stairs, move over, dragging the ball to the right. Once it's under the square to the left of the stairs (in the lower corridor), go out of the stair hallway to the room off to the left. Here, you'll find several Sparks, some Gels and a group of dormant Armos Statues. Kill the Gels, then touch the Statues one by one, then take down the animated soldiers with your boomerang. Push the block here aside and search the chest to get the Hyper Slingshot. Return to the blue owl. 
The Armos Statue in this room doesn't appear to move. But you can make him by looking at him funny. Make sure you don't kill anything else in the room, then tand three spaces to the north of him. Eventually, he'll wake up and move aside. Go into the area below and head up the stairs. Continue east until you find a chest that contains the Dungeon Map. See the magnet ball you left above? Grab it, but make sure you're pushing away, then slide to the right and the ball will fall on the floor switch. This will create a bridge in the lower right corner of this room. 
Return through the owl room to the chamber to the east. Go up the stairs to find yourself in the other part of the bridge room you were just in. Jump to the bridge and follow it to a stairway. Continue north on the path until you reach a jumping point across the lava. Hop across, then go down the stairs and look to the right. Equip your Glove and use it to attract yourself across this long strip of lava (using a distant magnet). Once on solid ground, continue to the right. 
In the next room, you'll encounter another owl. He says, "Icy cores make piercing blades." Everyone knows that. The door in the lower right corner of this room is the door to the mini-boss fight, but you might want to get some other stuff done first. Go to the upper right corner of the room and align yourself with the middle of three eye blocks. Shoot your new Hyper Slingshot (packed full of Mystery ammo) at the blocks, hitting all three at once. This will make a staircase. Go up it. 
In the room upstairs, use your Bombs on the cracked blocks below, then blow a path through this room in order to get to the left side. Slay the Knights here, then drop Bombs on the corners of the chest here. Once it's free, push a block to get inside it and you'll find a Small Key. Head back upstairs and go through the Mini-boss door. 
Frypolar comes in two flavors: deadly and deadlier. He begins as a fire creature, hurling fireballs at you. Later he'll turn to an ice creature, and in this form, he chucks spikes of ice. Needless to say, either of these things hurts immensely if you're nailed with it. To avoid these attacks, stay as far away from Frypolar as possible. When you see him cast an attack, watch for the shadow to see where it will fall, and get out of the way. 
The strategy to beating Frypolar is easy, but he's mighty fast, so you'll have to be on your toes. If he's in the fire form, use your Slingshot with Mystery Seeds to change him into the ice form. Then, quickly switch to Ember Seeds and hit him with those. That's it. Rinse and repeat. Stay as far away as possible and be patient. Eventually, you'll take down the baddie. 
Once the mini-boss fight concludes, exit to the north. In the next room, you'll have to light a series of torches using the Hyper Slingshot. First, light the central torch. Then quickly move to the right and light the three torches one the right wall with one shot (stand aligned with the center torch). Once these are lit, go to the opposite side of the room and light the other three. When all torches are lit, a staircase will appear on the right side of the platform. Go up the stairs. 
In the next room, exit to the north. The room above sports one of the toughest block puzzles in the game. Pushing a block on this slick surface will result in the block going until it hits something: a wall or another block. Here's how to do the puzzle: 
1. Push the ice block furthest to the left one space down, so it's resting on the purple row of blocks below. 2. Now push the same block to the right. It will come to rest against another ice block. 3. Push the same block again, this time to the north. It will come to rest against another ice block. 4. Push the block above the one you just pushed (the one farthest to the north) to the left. It will come to rest against a purple block near the western door.  5. Push the same block south until it comes to rest against the purple row of blocks below. 6. Now push that block over to the right. It will come to rest against the other ice block. 7. Push that block north (as you did with the first one).  8. Now, push all three blocks to the right, and they'll all come to rest in their appropriate yellow squares. 
Once the puzzle is done, a down staircase will appear on the north end of the room. Go down them to find yourself in another side-scrolling cave. This one can be tough if you don't move fast. The first room is a series of jumps up icy block "steps." Eliminate all the Keese in the room, then jump quickly from block to block until you reach the left side of the room. You don't want to linger on any of the blocks, though, or you'll end up sliding off. 
In the next room, you'll have to jump between a pair of conveyor platforms. Jump on the first one you see and fight against its pull. As you near the top of the room, you'll see another platform. Jump over to it, then quickly double-jump to the left to get to the next area. In this segment of the dungeon, you'll have to jump between a pair of Thwomp Blocks. The biggest thing to contend with here is the icy ledge. To eliminate its effects, simply jump and float immediately, landing on the first Block, then hopping over to the second.  Then leap to the ladder and exit the dungeon. Whew! 
In the room above, kill the Moldorms, then step on the floor switch at the south end of the room to extend a bridge. This will make it so that you don't have to battle all the way through that annoying dungeon every time you die. Exit the room to the east. 
In the next room, you'll encounter some whirling blades and a gaggle of Wizzrobes. Use your Cape to hop over the blades, then slay the 'Robes with your Sword. Move to the east exit. In the next room, slay the Gibdos and Snakropes, then go to the upper right corner. Equip your Boomerang and maneuver it to hit the ball switch, which will extend the bridge across the gap. Once it's extended, move to the southern exit. 
The following room has a couple of large, green platforms moving above a chasm. At the center of the room is a small platform with a bunch of vases and a  floor switch on it. Get on the platform and move to the left side of the room. Take down the Pols Voices with some Bombs, and the door to the south will open. Go through it. On a long dais in the next room is a chest containing the Boss Key. 
Once you get it, move south down the golden dais and hop down to the ice block room. Head back to the turnstile room and maneuever it so you come out on the east path. Here, you'll get a Small Key. Take it back to the block puzzle room. Exit through the west door. In the following chamber, you'll encounter a couple of Sparks. Take them down with the Boomerang, then collect the healing fairies each leaves behind. Exit on the left side of the room. 
Here, you'll see a blue owl, some Gels and a small dais with ice crystals on it. Take down the Gels, then go to the owl. He'll say something about melting the magical ice. Go to the dais and grab an ice crystal. Then take it to the room to the south and throw it into the fiery square. The best way to do this is to stand two spaces away from it and throw. This will cool down the lava in the room below. Take the stairs down to it. 
In the room below, fight through the Fire Keese to get to the chest on the right side of the room. There is a chest here that contains a Small Key. Grab it and head back upstairs. Go back into the blue owl room and drop a Bomb on the cracked portion of wall next to the mysterious bird. Enter the room that opens. 
Watch carefully as the Armos Statue traces a path on the tile. You'll have to mimic his pattern exactly, and each tile you get right will turn light brown. If you screw up, just leave the room and return and the puzzle will be reset. However, the puzzle changes each time it resets, so make sure you watch closely again. When the puzzle is finally complete, you'll get another Key. Return to the blue owl room. 
Grab another ice crystal and hop in the mine cart nearby. You'll be deposited in a room with Wizzrobes and a switch. Once out of the cart, put the ice down, hit the switch, then pick up the ice again and get back into the cart. You will end up in the room you rode through before. Get out and throw the ice into the fire chute. Again, this will clear up the lava problem in the room below. 
Go back down the stairs in the room south of the owl room. Once below, head to the north, and avoid the Fire Keese. Make your way to the staircase here and head up. Once upstairs, move to the right to find a pair of Armos Statues in the hallway. Avoid them and continue down the path, following it until you reach a small chamber buzzing with Sparks. Drop them with the Boomerang, then search the chest here to find a Small Key. Return to the blue owl room and grab another ice crystal. Then get into the mine cart. 
When you pop out, you'll be back in the Wizzrobe room. Put the ice crystal down and use a Small Key on the lock block here, then toss your ice crystal in the fire pit. This will cover the floor again. Then open the door to the south with the Small Key. Go back downstairs and left to the west, then the north. Go up the stairs here to emerge into a room full of Stalfos. Get in the cart here. In the next room, dodge laser blasts and exit north, into the Wizzrobe room. 
Go back to the owl room another time and get a fourth crystal. Then get back in the mine cart and return to the Wizzrobe room. Go through the south door into the laser cannon chamber. Take the ice crystal to the mine cart and hop in. In the Stalfos room, throw the final crystal into the fire, covering the lava below. 
Go down the stairs here. Grab the 10 Bombs out of the chest to the south, then keep heading north through precarious rooms full of Fire Keese until you reach a lock block. Use your last Small Key on it, then step through. Search the vases here to find health. You're going to be battling a Boss. 
Medusa Head, of course, will seek to turn you to stone. In order to combat this, you'll have to beat her at her own game. The Medusa Head will wing around the room shooting fireballs, lasers and stone attacks (white energy balls). Use your Cape to leap over these attacks. 
Equip your Seed Shooter with Pegasus Seeds and nail her whenever you can. When she freezes, charge in and slap her with the Sword. Then prepare to avoid her attacks again. You'll have to repeat this a bunch of times in order to beat her, but the fight is pretty straightforward. Once you beat the Head, you'll get the final Essence: Changing Seasons.

Dungeon 9 Onox's Castle - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The final dungeon is Onox's Castle. Take some time to wrap up treasure hunting and be sure to check out the Rings List so you are fully powered up. 
Go back to the Maku Tree with all eight Essences. He's so helpful! He'll give you the Huge Maku Seed, which will allow you to penetrate Onox's Castle. Before heading off to get crazy with Onox, go see Maple in Sunken City. Having a Magic Potion in your arsenal before you face him is almost necessary. 
Once you get a Potion, go to Tarm Ruins. Remember when you went to the Temple Ruins? Instead of going east at the morning star guard, take a left and head west to go to Northern Peak. Climb the stairs to Onox's Castle. There is a cosmic poo-storm that occurs when Link shows up with the Huge Maku Seed. Sit back and admire it. Then move toward the entrance to the castle. Before you get in, you'll be met by Twinrova. She's not so scary. Head north and slay the Fire Cats, then save your game and enter the Castle. 
To the east and west of the first castle room are chambers full of flying tiles. Use your Sword to swat them, then grab the health fairy that comes out. Once you get health, return to the first room and go north. There are a ton of Wizzrobes waiting for you. Use Pegasus Seeds to freeze them, then charge in and polish them off with your Sword. The doors will open when they die. Head through the north exit. 
In the next room, you'll face a bunch of Soldiers and Wallmasters. Again, use the Slingshot to freeze them, then move in and slay them with the Sword. Charged up Sword swipes work well. When they all drop, the doors will open again. Go north. 
Facade is your classic face-in-the-floor. Not a big deal. Throw Bombs on his ugly mug and watch out for the holes that he opens underfoot. After five explosions, his ugly puss will disappear. Grab the fairy he leaves behind, then save your game. 
Tip: If you are killed during your fight with Onox, before saving turn off your GameBoy and continue from the castle steps. This will save you time and a lot of trips to see Maple. 
When Facade drops, move north again. Grab anything you can from the vases here, then continue into Onox's chamber. 
The Onox fight is in two separate stages, and you'll probably have to see them both quite a few times in order to finally win. Din will appear for a moment, then split into four parts. But that's just a prelude to the awful nastiness of Onox. 
In the first stage, the only attack that will work on Onox is a spin attack. Meanwhile, he'll be trying to smash you to dust with his huge morning star. Use Pegasus Seeds to move quickly around the baddie. The whole time, hold down your Sword button to charge up. When Onox draws near, let fly with a spin attack. You'll have to do this seven times in order to beat the first part of this stage.

Dungeons - Final Fantasy XV Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story

After beating the game and some of these dungeons, you'll be able to get the Sealbreaker's Key! This allows you to return to many of these dungeons, and unlock a secret door near the end of the dungeon that delves into a deeper and harder maze boasting even tougher enemies. 
After completing the game, and clearing Balouve, Daurell, Crestholm, and Costlemark, travel to the Meldacio Hunter HQ in Cleigne and speak with Ezma to learn of these more challenging dungeons.

Easter Eggs and References - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains various Easter Eggs and References in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
A few ruined structures from ages past are still visible in Breath of the Wild, if you know where to look. The classic Temple of Time is an obvious one, and you can still hear the faint tunes of the classic Song of Time in the background. 

Another harder to spot location is in Central Hyrule. Here you can spot the ruins of Lon Lon Ranch, complete with the giant oval fence and crumbling tower off to the side. 
In The Breath of the Wild, there may be a living omage to former Executive Producer Satoru Iwata. The wandering NPC Botrick that you can meet on the roads of Western Central Hyrule sports Iwata's classic square-rimmed glasses and haircut - but that's not all. 
Botrick will talk about the nearby Satori Mountain, and a mythical Lord of the Mountain that lives there. If you ever spot a green glow emanating from the mountain, you can climb it to find a grove where the Lord of the Mountain dwells a - a spectral two-faced steed. If you take a picture with your Camera Rune, it will add new notes to the Hyrule Compendium. 
The notes state the many believe the Lord of the Mountain is the spirit of a Sage who dwelled on the mountain - and goes by another name - Satori. Satori is a japanese word for enlightenment, derived from the verb Satoru, matching the name of the late Nintendo executive. 
Upon revealing more of the map of Hyrule and inspecting many points of interest - some names might be recognizable. That's because a lot of the locales here have been named after other places and characters in previous Zelda games. 
They include, but are not limited to: 
Since the reveal of the E3 2016 Demo, eagle-eyed fans on the internet have noticed that many of the runes and ancient markings found on the Sheikah Slate and assocated Shrines are actually the ancient Hylian text, first debuted in earlier games that fans have produced a working alphabet for. 
Many of the Shrines and other areas feature subtle nods to what the location or item is and does. For example, certain text in the Shrine entrances read "Dungeon". 
Other, more humerous references can be found around the pillar that distills runes into your Sheikah Slate. Text reads fragments such as "All Your Base" from the infamously horrible localization of the game Zero Wing, to "Now Loading, Do not turn off your". 
Just like previous games in the series, you can abuse a Cucoo. It'll call for help and a flock of Cucoo will swarm you, given you attack it a few too many times. Make sure you go inside a building so you don't get hit by the diving Cucoo, as this can kill you in the beginning of your adventure! 

During one of the Nintendo Treehouse Livestreams, Mr. Miyamoto himself pointed out that Breath of the Wild takes several cues from the first Legend of Zelda, evoking the image of the concept art of the first game with Link kneeling at the edge of a cliff showing a grand view with twin peaks in the distance. These same peaks have been remade in Breath of the Wild, which can be seen from the starting area in the Great Plateau. 
You can obtain Link's Armor from the previous Zelda games randomly by using one of several Link Amiibos - different Links may give differerent armor sets. A new tunic, the Tunic of the Wild, can also be obtained by completing all 120 Shrines 
If you listen carefully to the background music at the Horse God Fairy Fountain, you will hear not only the Great Fairy Fountain music playing, but Epona's song (the classic horse summoning song from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask) is also playing alongside it 
The Divine Beasts' names are references to characters from earlier entries in the series. 

Easter Eggs - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains the Easter Eggs and references hidden throughout Horizon Zero Dawn. 
God Mode can be triggered inside the game, allowing you to travel anywhere (also called flying mode) 

 
The whirlpool in Horizon Zero Dawn is supposed to lead to the watery wormhole in the sky in Metal Gear Survive. 

 
Given that Horizon's Decima engine has been offered by Guerilla Games to Hideo Kojima's studio for use in Death Stranding, it's unsurprising that the Zero Dawn team would include a nod to their fellow developers. 
The Stranded Necklace, Stranded Shackles and Stranded Figure all reference items in the first two trailers for Death Stranding: Norman Reedus's dog tags, the handcuffs worn by Reedus and Del Toro in both trailers, and the ruined doll that is featured prominently in the second trailer for the game. 
The symbol for these collectibles is the iconic helmet that has become the logo for Kojima Productions. 
 


You can find them all yourself here.
Players with a keen eye for exploration can stumble across a hidden quest with valuable rewards. 
 


The Ancient Armory quest begins when Aloy finds any one of five Power Cells that will unlock a unique set of armor that can render her almost invincible.ster Egg

Editing Existing Pages - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
If a page is blank, it is waiting for you to provide useful information. All such "blank" pages start off that way (especially if you just add it to the NAV). Any page may be edited using the EDIT button on the top of each page. 
Additionally, you may edit individual sections topped by a HEADER or SUB-HEADER on the page. When you have those sections, only that section will change, and not the entire page. 
However, what is "useful information" on a page can vary widely. 
Writing technical documentation is not the same as playing a videogame. The toughest part is not simply listing tips for beating a game, but organizing all of that content into comprehensible sentences and paragraphs. 
The best way is to simply start with what you know - if you are a person who didn't know squat about the game and wanted to beat it, what would you look for? Approach it in that manner and you will have a solid start. 
Different pages on a wiki are judged by different criteria. 
An introduction of what the game is would be a good start. Many games are recognizable franchises - where does this particular game fit into the franchise's history? 
This page and its sections cover the controls of the game and other related topics, from describing the various HUD elements or how the game progresses. Other common questions should be answered here, or at least touched on: 
While it is tempting to answer all questions here, be wary of bloating the section with needless information. This is what a "Frequently Asked Questions" page is for. 
Remember that while some players may be familiar with videogames, many more are not. The "Basics" page should answer most, if not all, of a new player's questions. 
The section not only tells players how to beat the game from start to finish, but it should be organized into recognizable chapters, acts or missions which follow the structure used in the game's story mode. 
Naturally, pages for chapters or acts are not needed in sports games (although conferences and divisions are). A multiplayer only game like Warhawk need only sections for maps and different match types, while fighting games like Mortal Kombat may only require pages for moves lists. 
If you are at a loss for what structure to adopt for a particular wiki, please consult with IGN's guides editors. 
The achievements and trophies pages use special templates to display the amount of gamer points for a condition, as well as the trophy type earned. 
The name of the condition and its criteria should be copied verbatim from the game. Further elaboration on difficult, or "missable" achievements/trophies should be on its own respective page (and linked to from the main achievement & trophy page). 
This is a collection of frequently asked questions, along with working, valid answers and solutions. While not designed to be a substitute for an in-depth walkthrough, a FAQ can answer urgent questions or issues on a game. 
These pages are essentially items, collectibles, secret tasks, equipment and the like. Using styled tables to organize your data (alphabetizing helps) will be a huge step in sorting through all the stuff in a game. 
When you don't have time to locate items in a walkthrough, and only need to locate one thing quickly, a topical Appendix Page is far better tool.

Endless Space 2 Review - IGN

I first realized Endless Space 2 would be a game I'd enjoy upon discovering that one of its main factions is a race of treants called the Unfallen. They approach the grand 4X strategy adventure of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating by spreading peace and harmony throughout the galaxy. It's essentially the March of the Ents on a galactic scale, complete with featherweight philosophical talk in quest popups about fire being a force that both creates and destroys. Other turn-based 4X games might leave establishing faction personality at that, but Endless Space 2 goes even deeper, setting the Unfallen apart from their competition by giving them their own expansion technique that relies on spreading vines from system to system and connecting the whole endeavor to a central heart. That's but a taste of what makes Endless Space 2 one of the most aesthetically appealing 4X games to come out during the recent revival.
Underneath those colorful factions, though, are only a few notable features that set it apart from the familiar design of rest of the genre, as Endless Space 2 shows little interest in boldly going where no one has gone before. You'll gather various resources, research various technologies, and expand from a home planet to possible dominance of the entire galaxy. You'll find wildly different star systems with livable and resource-rich planets to colonize, and you'll occasionally have to deal with pirates and raiders in addition to aggressions from your neighboring space empires. You'll win through a wide range of victory conditions, including everything from economic to military dominance.
 poilib start 
Each race plays differently in significant ways.
 poilib end  But it's remarkable for the many options it allows for going about this business. For one, you can take the helm of one of eight races, which include everything from my beloved tree people to a race of clones based on an egg-headed man named Horatio who thinks entirely too highly of himself. (The titular "Endless" refers to an extinct race who've left nothing behind but their mysterious "Dust," which acts as a primary currency.) A healthy stable of factions isn't uncommon among 4X games, but Endless Space 2 considerably improves its replay possibilities by making each race play differently from one another in significant ways. The business of transporting citizens to colonies, for instance, is much simpler for the robotic Riftborn than it is for other races since they can just build new citizens on site. The Unfallen, meanwhile, extend their vines out to other systems, allowing them to colonize with relative freedom as long as those tendrils aren't cut off.

Follow the Runaways With These Essential Comic Books - IGN

If you don't know the Runaways, know is the time to start educating yourself. These renegade teen heroes are making their live-action debut in Hulu's Runaways TV series next year. And before that, Marvel is gearing up for a new Runaways comic as part of the Marvel Legacy relaunch.
Clearly, now is the time to get caught up on this cult-favorite franchise. That's where we come in. We've broken down the main Runaways saga chronologically, covering all the team's major appearances and other key stories they've appeared in over the years. We've tried to keep this article as spoiler-free as possible, as there's no substitute for experiencing the Runaways comics for yourself.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
The original volume of Runaways spanned 18 issues and told a pretty complete story about the rise of new teen superhero team. Here readers are introduced to strategic genius Alex Wilder, neophyte witch Nico Minoru, jock/tech whiz Chase Stein, surly loner Gertrude Stein, ethereal alien Karolina Dean and super-strong mutant Molly Hayes. These six Los Angeles-based youngsters discovered that their parents were all members of a secretive cabal of supervillains known as The Pride. Even as they come to terms with their own budding superhuman powers, these characters decide that the only way to escape their parents' influence is to go on the run and try to take down the Pride themselves. That innate distrust of authority (even groups like The Avengers) is one element that immediately set the Runaways apart from other Marvel teams. That, and the fact that Gert gained a pet dinosaur named Old Lace.
These first 18 issues lay the groundwork for everything to come with the team, following their struggles to remain one step ahead of their parents and the group dynamic that forms over time. The series eventually culminates with a shocking betrayal and the final confrontation between the Runaways and the Pride.
Essential Graphic Novels: Runaways Vol. 1: Pride & Joy, Runaways Vol. 2: Teenage Wasteland, Runaways Vol. 3: The Good Die Young
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
While original writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona remained on board the series after that initial 18-issue run, Marvel elected to relaunch the series to reflect the fresh jumping-on point after the end of the Pride conflict. With Runaways Vol. 2, the team settled into a more ongoing status quo, one that saw them remain off the grid and try to prevent other villains from taking advantage of the void left behind by the Pride.
The series introduced two crucial new members to the team in the form of cyborg Victor Mancha and Skrull refugee Xavin. The Runaways also began to interact with the wider Marvel Universe in this second volume, battling the New Avengers and meeting Marvel's original teen Runaways, Claok and Dagger.

Everything You Need to Know About the Zelda: Oracle Games - IGN

Capcom and Nintendo's Game Boy Color Zelda adventures have finally hit the 3DS eShop today. Oracle of the Ages and Oracle of the Seasons are both fantastic games in their own rights. If you don't believe me, check out the reviews -- both Ages and Seasons received the rare perfect 10 from IGN back in the day.
Now that we all have a chance to revisit these two portable classics via their release on the 3DS eShop, there's a good chance you'll need a bit of help along the way. Lucky for you, we have a pair of fantastic wikis that will teach you to master the weather in Oracle of Seasons, and help you control time in Oracle of Ages.
As you might know, Capcom's portable Zelda games were initially conceived as a trilogy of adventures dubbed the "Triforce Series." Originally called Mystical Seed trilogy, the three games were intended to communicate with one another and each be part of a single, larger experience. Eventually the trilogy was pared down to two of games, with hints of the third game scattered throughout Ages and Seasons.
Whether you're playing through these adventures for the first time, or revisiting them again a decade later, you owe it to yourself to grab these off the eShop.

Far Cry 5 Teasers Confirm American Setting, Full Reveal This Week - IGN

The short trailers end with a message saying that the game will be revealed this Friday, May 26.
Each one shows an image of rural America, then puncture the peace with an unsettling image (the man being used as a face-based bellringer is pretty unpleasant):
They also seem to counter rumours that said the game would take place in a Wild West setting (which would put it in more direct competition with this year's Red Dead Redemption 2) - clothing, weapons and buildings look more modern than the Old West would suggest.

"The Law of Inevitability" took place during the hours following Ray's untimely demise, giving us sort of a strange condensed Fargo chapter in the process. It was an episode that felt a bit constrained and strangled as it attempted to dole out the immediate aftermath of last week's big shock.
Firstly though, let's talk about the appearance of Mr. (Wes) Wrench there at the end, on the prison bus, as a huge callout to Season 1 and the Fargo mob who Lorne Malvo tore through during his path of chaos and murder. Yes, Wes Wrench, who apparently met Hanzee Dent as a child - the man who later morphed into mob boss Moses Tripoli.
So what does Wrench's appearance mean for Season 3? Is an entirely new outside force about to intervene in the story, perhaps on Nikki's behalf, or was he just there as an Easter egg to get squashed during the bus crash? Either way, something has to give with this latest Nikki cliffhanger. The series, despite its affection for random offings, has to be careful now when it comes to Nikki given all that she's survived. Was Yuri sawing away at that bus gate the show's way of telling us that she was done for? That she simply couldn't survive the night given all the forces out to kill her? Or was the pause button used here so that she could somehow skin-of-her-teeth out of yet another perilous predicament?
Nikki's terse clue about following the money, as well as the nice couple lines about Gloria visiting her one day with coconut creme pie, may have been her send off. Hell, it's more of a send off than most folks get on Fargo, so I can see this being the end for her. Her death might even galvanize Gloria even more. But - dammit! - I feel like she needs to scape by somehow. Again, I think I've mentioned this, but there are very few Fargo characters I actively root for. She's one of them.
Because Gloria will indeed now start sniffing around Sy, "following that money" and uncovering more of the conspiracy involving Varga. Because that's who Nikki thinks is behind Emmit's criminal dealings. At least, he's the one she was seeing when she almost got killed by Yuri. Though that's not to say Emmit's off the hook. He failed miserably at the "playing it cool" game when Winnie told him Ray was dead, blurting out "I've been here since six" before she even had the chance to relay the news.
Overall, coupled with Emmit's emotional collapse (complete with Varga's apropos Mother Goose rhyme) and Nikki's hanging fate, this episode was about Gloria's persistence and absolute refusal to bend to Moe's obtuse will. She's in business for herself at this point, seeking the truth no matter what her actual job title will be by the end of it. Hell, she may not even be a cop anymore by the time things get sorted out, but she's determined to not let other people's stories obscure, or replace, what actually happened.
I'm not sure what DJ Qualls' character is all about, or if he'll ever turn out to be more than a sleazy hitman, but it was a nice surprise to see him pop up here as the "cop" trying to kill Nikki. Was it a real cop or an imposter? Does Varga have a man on the inside? A third goon that we didn't know about? I'm assuming that when Meemo saw Nikki being taken into custody (caught in a motel window like Jerry Lundegaard!) he contacted someone who could take her out while she was behind bars.
Odds and ends:
Despite multiple attempts on Nikki's life, and a fun, perhaps game-changing, shot of Mr. Wrench on the bus at the end, Fargo simmered down a bit this week for a Christmas Eve episodes all about Gloria making pain-staking progress in her frowned-upon investigation.

Fargo: "The Lord of No Mercy" Review - IGN

Warning: Full spoilers for the episode below.  poilib start 
 poilib end 
"The Lord of No Mercy," one of Season 3's best episodes yet, will rightfully be remembered as the chapter where Emmit accidentally killed Ray during one last attempt to bury the hatchet and end their cruel squabbling. It was a harrowing, and wonderfully Fargo-y, accident that now changes the entire course the season. Ray's gone, an injured Nikki is hiding from both cops and crooks, and Gloria's main suspect has transformed into an entirely new murder case.

Farpoint Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Farpoint is an upcoming game revealed at E3 2016. It's a FPS VR game that seems to be set in space. In the brief teaser, we were shown people walking across a planet and discovering a very large, very angry creature. 
 


What little we know, is that your character works for the United Earth Project. The two main characters appear to be Dr.Tyson and Dr.Moon. It looks like you'll be tasked with surviving on this barren planet, looking for clues as to what is going on. 
As for what you will be facing, that isn't entirely clear yet. We do know there are some angry creatures on this planet that will act as Enemies, as we saw a very large crab like monster towards the end of the trailer. 
Farpoint requires you use the new PlayStation VR Aim controller. Unlike the Sharpshooter where a Move controller was needed to get the controller working, the VR Aim comes with built in motion and navigation sensors. 
 
Its 1-to-1 tracking allows you to point in a particular spot or angle in the real world to have your virtual gun point at a target in the game at the same time.

Farpoint Review - IGN

Farpoint is one of the first games developed for PlayStation VR that feels like more than a tech demo, a proof of concept, or a traditional game with VR features slapped on as an afterthought. That works to its advantage, because while it would be a mediocre shooter if you played it on a normal screen, in VR it feels good, especially when you play with the new PlayStation VR Aim Controller.
Fifty Shades of Grey Enjoys Huge Debut at Weekend Box Office - IGN

There was no safe word rival movies could use to stop Fifty Shades of Grey from whipping their butts this weekend, both at home and abroad.
The highly-anticipated adaptation of the erotic bestseller dominated the domestic box office with an estimated $81.7 million, and grossed a staggering $158 million overseas, the biggest international opening of 2015 so far and the biggest R-rated opening ever internationally.
The Universal-Focus movie, reportedly budgeted at $40 million, currently has a worldwide cume of $239.7 million.
Fifty Shades' domestic haul makes it the biggest Valentine's Day weekend opening ever, and the second highest-grossing February release behind The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million).
Kingsman: The Secret Service, Fox's adaptation of the Mark Millar comic book, opened in second place with an estimated $35.6 million. That's director Matthew Vaughn's second biggest domestic opening behind X-Men: First Class ($55.1 million). The movie, which has already been playing abroad, has a worldwide total of $79.4 million.
Meanwhile in limited release, the vampire satire What We Do in the Shadows opened in L.A. and New York City this weekend with a strong $65,830.
Here are the three-day weekend estimates via Rentrak:
1. Fifty Shades of Grey $81.7 million
2. Kingsman: The Secret Service $35.6 million

Final Fantasy 9 Announced for PC and Mobile in Japan - IGN

Final Fantasy IX will be making its way to PC and smartphones in Japan, Square Enix has announced.
According to the publisher's official announcement, the beloved Japanese role-playing game, which first launched on the original PlayStation back in 2000, will available on PC, iOS and Android "soon."
There's no word on when or if the game will be getting similar treatment in the west. That said, Square Enix hasn't shied away from releasing its other Final Fantasy ports outside of Japan, so an announcement for North America and Europe is likely just a matter of time.
Earlier this month, Final Fantasy VI released on Steam, joining the likes of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, and several others. Which entry in Square Enix's beloved role-playing series is your absolute favorite? Let us know in the comments.

F is For Family: Season 2 Review - IGN

This is a mostly spoiler-free review for all 10 new episodes of Netflix's F is for Family, which lands on May 30th. 
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Things get even bleaker in the second season of Bill Burr's F is For Family - a raunchy, no-holds-barred animated series tasked with juggling ton of different tones and themes.
Firstly, it's a time portal that takes us back to a different, and more dangerous, era of child rearing, employment, and relationships. Secondly, it's a comedy -- albeit, one with an avalanche of anger at its core -- that seeks to enlighten while it parodies. On top of all this, it's social commentary mixed with a love story mixed with a handful of coming of age tales.
Plus, it occasionally dabbles in the type of absurdist humor you'd see on something like The Critic or Family Guy. So, at times, the show's spinning a lot of plates, but at the heart of it is the tale of a father and husband who never wound up making his dreams come true and now trudges through life unknowingly trying to crush everyone else's aspirations. And honestly, that's a theme that can resonate no matter the era. The poison that can spread through a family because of untreated and unaddressed depression and/or misery.
Adding to patriarch Frank Murphy's burdened psyche this season is the fact that he's out of work during a particularly low point in our country's economy. Picking up where Season 1 left off, where Frank got laid off on Christmas, the Murphys aren't doing so hot. It's hard to notice sometimes because their status quo isn't all the great either, and usually involves a steady course of screaming and swearing at all of life's indignities, from the parents on down to the youngest daughter, but Frank's fragile ego is put through the wringer this year as wife Sue is tasked with not only contributing more on the job front, but actually, at one point, becoming the sole full-time earner.
With Sue landing a J-O-B, F is for Family is able to take a harsh and vulgar look into the rampant, and accepted, chauvinism of the time for women in the workplace. Previously, Sue only had to suffer the sort of humiliation a husband back then would dish out, but now she finds herself in a whole new cringe-worthy crucible of crass, gross men out to stamp her down at every turn.
I think I'd say, out of everything addressed this season, the idea of men feeling absolutely threatened by women, to the point where a woman's success automatically implies their failure, is a very important topic, because this theme bleeds into the Murphys' marriage and almost destroys it. Sue is allowed to do anything she wants provided it's not anything better, or perceived to be better, than what Frank's doing.
This series might spend most of its time repeating the same screaming fits over and over, to the point where you, like the Murphy children, begin to tune out and accept it as background noise, but there's a formidable spine underneath. You know, when the volume's allowed to drop a little and the characters actually begin to find some internal clarity. It's basically this reason, this particular story, along with the flashbacks (that serve as reminders) to Frank and Sue's courtship and loving agreement to be a team, that this season is getting graded a few ticks above Season 1.
Five Awesome 3DS eShop Games Coming This May - IGN

The 3DS doesn't really need any more help being awesome these days - especially with Animal Crossing: New Leaf right around the corner. But even though many 3DS owners will be busy collecting fruit and playing mayor in a few weeks time, don't think that means you're doomed to an existence of anxious boredom in the meantime.
Below are five games coming to the 3DS eShop this month that are absolutely worth your attention. Mark your calendar and let the fun begin!
 poilib start 
 poilib end  
Kicking off the fun is Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, which hits the 3DS eShop on May 9 (check out our preview here). It's the latest entry in the Mario vs. DK series - albeit without the "vs." and with a whole different take on mini madness. It has four different modes, the main one challenging players to place different tiles using the touch screen to clear a path for toy Mario. It's a ton of fun, and a lot more challenging than you would think - definitely a breathe of fresh air for the series. There's also quite a bit to do, as Minis on the Move features 180 different puzzles, as well as supplementary mini-games and a level creator.

 poilib start 
 poilib end  
Next up is Mega Man 5, which is finally following in the footsteps of its fellow 8-bit predecessors by making its way to the 3DS Virtual Console on May 16. This NES classic has the Blue Bomber saving Dr. Light from the clutches of Protoman. More Mega Buster action is always a good thing, and you can't argue with an epic Mega vs. Protoman brawl, so definitely pick this one up if you're a fan of old school, 2D action. Again, Mega Man 1-4 are already available for download, and 6 is coming soon.

 poilib start 
 poilib end  
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D will be available both in stores and on the eShop starting May 24. This is a 3D remake of the popular Wii game from Retro Studios. Not just a straight port, this version has some added features to round out the package and make it more portable-friendly, including an additional easy mode that gives the player more health and allows them to take more damage (don't worry - you can still play the "original mode" as well). There are also eight new levels found in a brand new world, which you unlock after beating the game, as well as new items and local multiplayer.
 poilib start 
 poilib end  
Two of the most underrated Zelda games are finally getting second life when GameBoy Color classics Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons hit the eShop on May 30. Co-developed by Nintendo and Capcom, the games are similar in style to GameBoy masterpiece Link's Awakening, and can be linked together via a password system that is implemented in a rather unique way and allows for some cool stuff... which I won't spoil for you. Any Zelda fan (or lover of awesome, topdown adventures) owes it to themselves to play these games.

 poilib start 
 poilib end  
Rounding out the list is The Denpa Men 2: Beyond the Waves, which is available for download on May 30 (check out our preview here). It's an unexpected sequel to quirky eShop RPG The Denpa Men: They Came By Wave, and is being touted as an expanded and more refined version of the original concept. This game may not have the likes of Mario, Link or Donkey Kong to help its cause and grab your attention, but if it's anything like the original, it will be a surprisingly delightful experience well worth the download.

Follow the Sheikah Slate - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Welcome to IGN's Walkthrough for the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This page contains information on the first major quest in the game - Follow the Sheikah Slate. 
Breath of the Wild is a very open-ended game, a first for the series. As such, the guide below is just one of many possible ways you can experience the game. We recommend you take time to explore the world at large in-between the main objectives you are given. 
 


Video Guide: Follow the Sheikah Slate
After you've left The Shrine of Resurrection and begun exploring the Great Plateau, a voice will ask you to use your Sheikah Slate. 
Look on your map for the yellow map point placed over on the Northeast side of the Great Plateau. You'll most likely have to face a few Bokoblin on the way over to the large rock formation - so be sure you have some weapons on you, and be sure to loot more from the Bokoblins you kill. 
Your target looks like some ruins covered in rocks, with a pedestal just poking out from under large brown rocks. Place your Sheikah Slate onto the pedestal, and the entire place will rumble and shake as a large imposing tower bursts from the ground taking you high up into the air. This is one of many Resurrection Towers spread across Hyrule, and you'll note similar towers rising up all over the land. 
Interacting with one of these towers will extract the regional map info for the area you are currently located in, in this case, you'll get a much more detailed view of the Great Plateau. Activated towers also serve as fast travel spots, letting you quickly get across Hyrule when you start finding more towers. The towers themselves also make great sightseeing vistas, allowing you to quickly get a lay of the land, mark interesting points on your map, and plan your next move. 
As Link looks off in the distance, a voice will call to him, explaining a bit of the mystery of your awakening, and the evil that you are now destined to face: Calamity Ganon. It will be up to you to stop him - but first things first: You need a way to get off the Great Plateau. 
Get down from the tower by either climbing the sides carefully down, or looking for small platforms below that go down in a circle letting you safely drop down to the next platform. When you reach the bottom, you'll be greeted by the mysterious Old Man who will give you your next big task on The Isolated Plateau.

What the heck is a wiki?

Our attempt to answer issues which most commonly occur on IGN's wikis.
            




                                                Nintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in the epic quest The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. This adventure is set on the mysterious Koholint Island, a place where dreams and reality collide. As a castaway, Link must find a way to escape from the island and return to his beloved homeland of Hyrule. 

But it won't be as easy as chartering a boat. The island's inhabitants have no knowledge of the outside world. One creature, a talking owl, may know the solution to Link's dilemma, but first Link must tackle eight dungeons full of treacherous monsters and tricky traps. His goal: find the eight Instruments of the Sirens and awaken the omnipotent Wind Fish which rules the island. Link must battle new enemies and make new friends in order to make it to the end of this in-depth fantasy story.

Colorized for Game Boy Color, this revised DX version of the Game Boy Classic features a new dungeon to explore (playable exclusively on Game Boy Color) as well as the ability to take pictures and print them using the Game Boy Printer.                    


Release Date: 1998

GBC Cheats - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains a list of cheats, codes, Easter eggs, tips, and other secrets for The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons for Game Boy Color. If you've discovered a cheat you'd like to add to the page, or have a correction, please click EDIT and add it. 
Warp to Tarm ruins and go south to the Lost Woods. You'll find a Deku Scrub who loves music. One screen west of him is an unusual Like-Like. Like-Likes respawn without you having to leave the screen.  Using the Maple's Ring, kill 15 of the creatures, and go east one square.  You should have an encounter.  Repeat at will.
Submitted by He look-a like-a like-like
Time your Gasha plantings! Plant plenty of gasha seeds in places you won't forget, go to your next level, complete the level up to the point where the boss is, and before fighting the Boss, harvest your nuts. If you did badly with the Miniboss etc, they are more likely to give you hearts. 
  
You will probably get several rings, a potion and some hearts if you had enough. Once you have harvested all of the nuts, plant Gahs seeds in their place. Go defeat the Boss, and come back, you will have more nuts. 
 
Go to Subrosia for Gasha seeds. They are at:   (1) Subrosian dance  (2) Treasure hunt house  (3) Market 
 
Go into the waterfall in the room in the Temple of Seasons where you get the Rod of Seasons to enter a secret room with absolutely nothing in it. To get into another room that has absolutely nothing, use the Shovel behind the clock-maker's house in Horon Village. 
In the second dungeon you can bomb a wall with the blocks in the form of an arrow pointing to the west wall. Go inside and find a room full of rupees. 
When you pick a new game enter: NNNNN NNNNN NNNNN NNNNN. You will start with the Victory Ring and a very odd name. 
Not only do you get a strange  name and the Victory Ring (The evil king Ganon defeated), you also have  an extra heart container, and, when you go to Bipin and Blossom's  house, the baby also has a strange name.

Geoff Johns Continues DC Rebirth Saga in 'Doomsday Clock' - IGN

DC's Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns is returning to comics later this year to continue the work he started with DC Universe Rebirth #1. Johns, artist Gary Frank and colorist Brad Anderson will chronicle the long-awaited meeting between Superman and Watchmen's Doctor Manhattan in a mini-series entitled Doomsday Clock.
Doomsday Clock was first revealed by Syfy Wire. The mini-series appears to serve as the endgame of the current DC Rebirth status quo, building directly on the events of both DC Universe Rebirth #1 and the Batman/Flash crossover "The Button" (which is set to wrap up in The Flash #22 on May 17). The series will explore the fallout when the DC and Watcmen universes collide, as Superman's innate sense of hope and optimism clash with Manhattan's cynical attempts to experiment with the fabric of the DCU.

Geth Attack part 4 - Mass Effect Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story

Walkthrough - Feros - Geth Attack part 4 
Enemies will be encountered in two primary waves, and both are pretty much the same as the other. Sadly, there are Geth enemies in both waves that can only be damaged with missiles, so be sure to train your missiles on them to deplete their health and shields simultaneously. During the second enemie encounter, after taking out the Geth Colossus with your Mako cannon, you might want to leave the mako and snipe the remaining Geth troopers on foot (for more xp). On top of that there's a passage here, to the right, just in front of a crate, that leads into an underground corridor where, at the northern end of it, another Geth awaits you. After you take him down, you'll find an upgrade kit and a secure storage locker. Then head back to the Mako and continue. When you've finally reached the end of the Skyway, you should then get out of the Mako and seek out a subtle pathway leading down into the concrete structure. You'll find some friends below. 
  
In this small refugee camp, there's little to do of interest except to look for an ExoGeni representative named Ethan Jeong, who will be speaking with a Feros worker of some rank named Juliana Baynham. As you speak with them, you'll find that Ethan is a bit of a coward while Juliana has the situation more under control. You'll learn that the Geth seem to be interested in the ExoGeni building, which you can traverse another Skyway to reach. And you'll also learn that these people thought all other humans on the planet had been killed (which isn't true). It's time to head to ExoGeni, to give these people some hope. 
  
  
Head back to the Mako and continue to drive up the incline towards another garage door. This will lead to the Skyway-like corridor that will lead directly to the ExoGeni main building. Like last time, you'll have to fight plenty of Geth. But since you'll have your Mako, you shouldn't have too much of a hard time. Be sure to keep an eye on the structural integrity of the Mako, repairing it as needed, and don't for any reason get out of the vehicle while the Geth are firing at you. You stand a much higher survival rate when you stay inside the Mako, especially with all of these missiles flying around that would otherwise end you in a single hit, even with full health and shields.

Gotham: "Pretty Hate Machine" Review - IGN

Warning: Full spoilers for the episode below.  poilib start 
 poilib end 
I suppose you could consider "Pretty Hate Machine" (named after the breakthrough Nine Inch Nails album) Season 3's penultimate episode since next week's finale is being billed as a two-hour event. And it makes even more sense to think of it that way given how many storylines were packed into this action-heavy chapter that criss-crossed Bruce's brainwashing arc with Jim's escalating Lee issues.
At one point, toward the end, Harvey and Alfred were simultaneously trying to stop the virus bomb from going off and save Jim from suffocating in a buried coffin. Everything was getting mashed together in a strange and mostly unsatisfying way. But then Jim injected himself with the virus - and the bomb went off despite everyone's best efforts! Nothing got thwarted here and that's the type of Gotham I enjoy watching.
Now, before I pat the episode on the back too rambunctiously, let's just remind ourselves that Jim, once a-freakin-gain, found himself the target of some lunatic's bizarre and overwrought plot to torture him. No one ever just kills the person they want to kill on Gotham. Even Penguin escaped death twice in this episode because Riddler needed to make a long-winded point and it allowed enough time for distractions and last-minute saves. It happens all the time. Hell, it just happened last week with Jim and Barnes. Yes, remember last week when Jim found himself captured by a crazy and put through some sort of poorly-conceived arch-villain nonsense designed to fail. It. Just. Happened.
Still, I like Dark Lee. You know, even if she's just as crazily obsessed with Jim now as Barbara was when the stunning Ms. Kean kidnapped Lee to make an elaborate, overly-theatrical point about her undying love. Dark Lee is much more interesting than mopey Lee, misunderstanding everything Lee, and Doakes Lee. Now, I don't know what fate awaits her by season's end, but the fact that she and Jim are both infected with the virus, and the bomb went off, probably means that a cure's on the way. Lucius will probably busily fashion one off-screen - since that's where Lucius has been relegated to ever since he helped stop Riddler.
Let's talk about this virus now. The plan here is that Gotham will tear itself apart because...a few thousand people are infected? I thought this was going to be a bigger blast than that. The city holds millions. How is this going to level Gotham? More specially, how is this catastrophe any different really, or bigger in scope, than what Jerome just did in his one night of murderous chaos? Things are getting less fuzzy as it pertains to the League and how it essentially used the Court as a tool to get League-y things done, but this is a poor master plan if the intent is to bring Gotham to its knees. This is like an every other weekend occurrence for the city at this point.
So yeah, as soon as Raymond J. Barry's boss monk (billed as "The Shaman") mentioned that "thousands" would fall I began to question the overall severity of this evil scheme. Again though, it was nice to see the bomb actually detonate this time since -- because Gotham repeats the same beats over and over -- Bruce was handed the trigger as part of his full indoctrination. Just like Jim was put in charge of a detonator a few weeks ago.
Gotham crammed a lot into its quasi-penultimate Season 3 chapter as the show's sloppiness collided with its elevated endgame stakes. Jim and Lee went full Tetch virus, Bruce went full League, and the gas bomb went off in the middle of town. Honestly, there are no rules at this point (Alfred's allowed to just point guns at people and/or dangle them from rooftops) so I'm curious to see how next week's two-parter will try and convince us that there's an actual police force in the city.

Great Fairy Fountains - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the Great Fairies of Hyrule still exist, though not many have ever seen one, and their locations have faded into legends told by travelers. For one so brave as to find one, that person could gain new power - for a price. 
There are four Great Fairies to be found in Hyrule, each residing in a large closed orange flower that can sometimes be seen from a distance. These large flowers are also often surrounded by the familiar pink Fairies that you can grab if you sneak up on them quietly. Upon finding a Great Fairy, you'll find that the reclusive fairies won't be able to reveal themselves until they can gain power - which involves a monetary transaction. 
 


Video Guide: All Fairy Fountain Locations
Once you've agreed to pay said one-time transaction (which can vary depending on the fairy), the Great Fairy will burst forth revealing a splendid fairy fountain. In exchange for your heroic donation, each of the Great Fairies will offer to upgrade your Armor to bolster its effects and defense - however doing so will require several Materials that depend on the Armor chosen, and how upgraded the armor already is. This will add a star to the armor - showing that it has been upgraded. For every upgrade, you'll get another star. 
This also means you can upgrade your armor from different fairies for the same effect. 
Upon unlocking each successive Great Fairy, all Great Fairies will become more powerful. In other words, all Fairies strengthen each other upon being released. It does not matter which order you unlock them in. 
There are four Great Fairy Locations found across Hyrule. 
Great Fairy Cotera can be found in the hills above Kakariko Village, in a clearing just past Tal'noh Naeg Shrine. 
Great Fairy Kayasa can be found in the Tabantha Region, south of Totori Lake and the Rito Village. If you climb up the Tabantha Tower, look along the South side of the tower and you should be able to spot the large green flower bud below you on the ridge across from the tower - and you can glide all the way to it. 
Great Fairy Mija can be found in the Akkala Region far in the Northeast. It is located along the Southeastern lip of the lake, just to the East of Dah Hesho Shrine. You can spy the grove of green, yellow, and orange trees it hides in by looking from the Akkala Tower towards the East, just past the Dah Hesho Shrine. 
Great Fairy Tera is one of the hardest to find, located in the vast desert of the Gerudo. To get there you'll likely need heat or cooling effects to survive the extreme temperatures of the day and night, as well as a Sand Seal to make travelling easier. Head to the far Southwestern tip of the map (and note that your map functions may not work in some of the sandstorm areas. You'll need to be on the lookout for a large skeleton under which both the Hawa Kosh and Fairy Fountain are located. 
Both similar and yet different to the Great Fairies of Hyrule is Malanya the Horse God. Like the Great Fairies, she's located in a hidden fountain - in the Lake Hylia Region of Hyrule, South of Highland Stable that you can reach by following the road West until it curves back across a small bridge. 
Malanya will ask for a flat rate of 1,000 Rupees - regardless of whether you've freed other Great Fairies. She also looks...very different from the others. 
Once free, Malanya will let you resurrect any horses you have registered that have died under your care. This includes rare and legendary horses like the White Horse, Big Horse, and Epona.

The Gunrunning update introduces two new locations that can be purchased by aspiring arms dealers: a bunker and a Mobile Operations Center. 
The bunker is a large underground base, complete with living quarters and storage - you MOC can also be kept here - also contains workshops for you to upgrade and customize your weapons and vehicles. 
The Mobile Ops Center is a customizable oversided tractor-trailer, which not only allows players to begin new jobs on the go but also can be outfitted with a living area and weapons / vehicle workshops. 
These new vehicles are rides that, as indicated, are able to be fitted with powerful weapons and armor. 
These can range from a dune buggy with a mounted machine gun to an amphibious APC and even a trailer equipped with anti-aircraft guns. These vehicles, it seems, can be purchased and upgraded in bunkers and via the Mobile Ops Center.

Hearthstone: Every Journey to Un'Goro Card - IGN

Hearthstone's next expansion, Journey to Un'Goro, will be with us on April 6 (or possibly April 7 depending on where you live), and we've now seen the entire 135 card set. It's a little hard to say how the meta is going to change as a result, but one thing's for sure - Blizzard has introduced some pretty interesting new concepts and mechanics. Every class, for instance, has a legendary Quest card, and if you fulfil the requirements of the quest you'll get a pretty epic - and unique - reward. Crucially, the one mana Quest cards will always be in your opening hand (unless you mulligan it away) so you can build your deck around the quest and get started right away.
There's also a heap of cards with the new Adapt keyword, which functions a little like Discover. Players are presented with three choices, drawn from a pool of ten, and whatever they choose is then instantly applied to the base card. The idea is that players can adapt to the situation at hand, and it's certainly a pretty awesome concept.
The last major piece of the puzzle for Un'Goro are Elementals - the new tribe that's being formalised for this expansion. Elementals, after all, have always been in the game (Fire Elemental, Magma Rager, etc) but now they're tagged as such. This then ties into Elemental synergy, and a mechanic that rewards you for playing an Elemental the turn before. It's an intriguing concept, as it theoretically gives your opponent information about what you might do on the following turn, which they can then try to play around. It could also result in some fairly linear deck types, where players try and curve out by chaining Elementals. We'll see!
I've created slideshows for each of the classes below, as well as for neutral cards and the Adapt options. Each slideshow also includes "reward" cards (if they're not self explanatory), such as the Quest reward cards or the subsequent versions of the Mage legendary minion Pyros. These cards are immediately after the card that spawns them.

Horses and Mounts - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are more than just basic horses to find in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
Wild Horses are found in many places - from the fields of Central Hyrule, to the grasslands of the Dueling Peak and around Lake Hylia, all the way to the plains in Akkala or the snowy tundras of the Hebra Mountains and beyond. The stats of the horse may improve if you venture into dangerous areas - but you'll never know how good your horse is until you register them. Their stats can be as low as one star or as high as four in any category. 
House of Cards: Season 5 Review - IGN

This is a non-spoilery review for all 13 new episodes of House of Cards: Season 5, which is now available on Netflix. For those who've finished Season 5, I talk about story specifics and the ending to the season as a whole over on the House of Cards: Season 5 Spoiler Discussion Page.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
As part of Netflix's giant month without chill -- May -- which saw the return of Bloodline, Sense8, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Ranch, and F is for Family, House of Cards' fifth season was squeezed in under the wire, on Tuesday the 30th, so that it could be make the Emmy cut-off date for nominations. Had it just waited one more week and dropped on Friday, June 2nd, there would have been no hope for Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, or any of the other performers on this once-buzzed about Netflix Original to possibly get recognized for their work on the show.
That's important, because the performances here, five years in, are still formidable and ferocious, representing a combination of both fury and repression, resentment and ambition. If you're a fan of the Underwoods and their ever-evolving, revolving, political circus of pain then you obviously recognize the work the stars are putting in when it comes to crafting these characters and creating this particular alternative dimension of malaise and malice.
Everyone's somehow working themselves to death, double-dealing, back-stabbing, playing all sides, and looking out for numero uno simultaneously. It's a show that can dive into the grinding minutia of politics power plays and then, out of nowhere, become histrionic and Shakespearean.
The trick here, as always with House of Cards, is balancing those tones. This is a series that's prominently featured flat out murder in the name of grubby political power grabs and then spent handfuls of episodes featuring its key players playing by the "rules" while trying to scramble to get votes, win support, convince people to change loyalties in order scratch and claw their way out of various dilemmas of their own doing. And it's all played, more or less, on the same level. Basically, taking someone's life is almost as routine of a measure as campaigning, lobbying, making secret deals, approving covert missions, etcetera. It's an issue that House of Cards hasn't been able to fully fix.
In Season 2, the murder of Zoe Barns shot the series into tumultuous territory. Sure, Frank had murdered back in Season 1, but the fact that Zoe's death came at the very end of the Season 2 premiere, coupled with the "shock" surrounding her being one of the show's main characters, created a story gateway that felt grating and overly-sensational. Since then however, save for Doug murdering Rachel, the show mostly buried itself back into politics and Frank Underwood's constant struggle to exist in a world where his innumerable sins threaten to take him down at every turn.

How to Buy a House - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it's possible to own your very own home! To do so, you must travel to West Necluda into Hateno Village. 
Just to the West of Myahm Agana Shrine, look for a small footbridge behind the Bolson Construction Homes to find an abandoned house with men working to demolish it. 

Speak to Bolson - the man in pink pants, and tell him you want to buy the house. 
How to Catch a Horse - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Catching a horse is one of the tasks given to Link at the Dueling Peaks Stable in the Dueling Peaks Region of Hyrule. 
The keys to catching a horse are stealth and stamina.  Multi-colored horses are easier to catch, but have poorer stats. 
You must approach horses slowly and from behind. If the horse spots you, it will run away. By pressing down on the Z button, Link will crouch down and crawl walk towards the horse.  Wearing armor from the Sheikah Set is the most effective for increased stealth. 
When you get close enough, press A to mount and immediately the horse will immediately begin to try to buck you off.  Press L rapidly to soothe your horse.  You will need a lot of stamina to stay on your horse.  If you get bucked off, try again when you have upgraded your stamina wheel. 
To upgrade your stamina wheel, you can consume elixirs that increase your stamina (see elixirs), or trade four spirit orbs at any goddess statue for a stamina vessel. 
To increase your bond with your new horse, you can take it for a ride.  It will randomly pull in a direction, correct it and immediately sooth it and you will see a puff of pink smoke indicating an increase in your bond. 
Protip: To quickly bond with your horse, drop at least 10 apples on the ground in front of it.  For each apple, your bond will increase 10%. 
Ride your horse back to any stable and speak to the stable owner from the outside. He will ask if you would like to board your horse and will sell you a bridle and saddle for 20 rupees. You will be able to name your horse, but won't be able to change it.  You can have a maximum of five horses stored with the stables and can access your horses from any stable at no additional charge. 
There are four other horses you can mount: White Horse, Giant Horse, Lord of the Mountain and Stalhorse. The Lord of the Mountain and Stalhorse cannot be registered at stables, but are fun to ride. 
You can also mount creatures including: Honeyvore Bear and Grizzlemaw_Bear]] and Mountain Buck, but you cannot register these at creatures stables. 
The power Lynels can be mounted in order to deal additional damage, but staying on is very tricky. 
Good luck and happy hunting!

How to Cook - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Cooking is an essential activity in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. While exploring, Link must collect materials and ingredients from the world in order to make nutritious meals to refill his heart containers. Sometimes, a meal or elixer is needed to grant Link cold, fire, or lighting resistance so he can safely travel extreme terrain if he doesn't have the tunic for it. Some food grants extra buffs as well, like heightened stealth or increased attack. 
Some of these ingredients can be consumed raw in order to heal, but to get the most out of your food, and to receive any buffs, you must cook it first. 
 


How to Counter Deadshot - Injustice 2 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains strategies and tips for fighting against Deadshot in Injustice 2. 
The deadly assassin has become a particularly frustrating opponent for some players, as they have great difficulty avoiding his many projectile attacks that are highly effective at both long and short range. 
As with most challenges in gaming, solving "the Deadshot problem" takes an even temper and patience above all else. 
Because you the button for blocking and retreating are one and the same, you aren't able to move towards Deadshot while trying to block his incoming attacks, unless you're using a character with an armored charge attack like Bane. 
To that end, you'll need to slowly advance across the play field, often very slowly, stopping to duck and block if Deadshot is spamming wrist cannon attacks. His response will likely be to dash backwards -- maybe throw in some trick shots, low rifle shots, or enhanced versions of any of his special moves -- but stay disciplined and keep inching forward until he eventually has nowhere to go. 
Once you manage to close the distance between you and your opponent, use your most powerful combo attacks to take down as much health as possible before they can counter the assault.

How to Defeat a Hinox - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are four types of Hinox:  Hinox, Blue Hinox, Black Hinox and Stalnox 
With the exception of the Stalnox, Hinox are always asleep as you approach them. Link can use stealth to climb onto its body to swipe the weapons away from its necklace. When ready for combat, strike its eye with an arrow to wake it up. 
Hitting a Hinox in the eye with an arrow is the easiest way to slow them down.  Using a two-handed weapon on the legs is the easiest way to deal massive damage. The Blue Hinox and Black Hinox will cover their eye up if you start dealing too much damage. Use this as an opportunity to get close to its legs and wail away with your weapons. 
If the Hinox has wooden leg armor, you can light it on fire with using fire arrow. Do not hit the legs with a weapon before destroying the armor as this will reduce your weapons durability. It the armor is made of metal, a shock arrow will do the trick. 
Bows and arrows are essential when fighting a Hinox if you want to leave it vulnerable. Use a Fire Arrow or Shock Arrow for Blue Hinox or Black Hinox. Two-handed weapons, axes, and hammers are great for dealing massive damage quickly, especially if you charge the spin attack. Just double check for leg armor before you swing! 
The bigger the weapon, the better for this type of miniboss!

How to Defeat a Lynel - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

How to Defeat a Talus - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Stone Talus are slow moving, but hit hard. On their backs is a dark stone, which is their weak point. Running around the Stone Talus can be effective, since it moves so slow. Watch for its swinging arms though if you decide to run close. You can use a bomb to temporarily destroy its arms and knock it over. This gives you an opening to climb on its back and hit its weak point. 

Some Stone Taluses must be climbed to reach their weak point. Others can be struck from the ground. 
How to Dye Armor - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link now has the ability to dye certain pieces of Armor that you'll find across Hyrule. 

There's a specialty dye shop located only in Hateno Village, in the far West Necluda area of Hyrule. Once there, look for the large building with colored vials - the Kochi Dye Shop - and speak to the man, Sayge, inside. For 20 Rupees, you can dye all of the armor you are currently wearing - plus five ingredients that match the color you desire. These ingredients can be mixed and match from the available colors - so long as you hold five in total. 
Note that certain pieces of armor, like the Old Shirt, Well-Worn Trousers, Champion's Tunic, and any jewelry or Amiibo armor cannot be dyed. You can also unequip certain armor pieces if you only want to dye just the Head Armor or certain parts. You can also ask to revert your dyed clothing to it's original color. 
Below you'll find a list of every color you can dye your armor - and the known ingredients you can use for that color type.

How to Earn More Money in Tekken 7 - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
No matter what mode you play in Tekken 7, you'll receive fight money as a reward for completing matches. If you win a match, you'll receive more fight money than when you lose. Online matches still reward fight money to you even if you aren't the victor. But in order to purchase all of the unlockable items, titles, and content in Tekken 7; you'll need to maximize the amount of fight money you draw in. 
Here some great tips to keep your money making skills flowing and obtain the maximum amount of fight money possible when you play Tekken 7. Each of these tips will help you gain the most from each match and allow you to purchase those desired items and titles much faster. 
For every match you win in Treasure Battle, you'll receive a certain amount of fight money. The more matches you win, the more fight money you'll receive with each victory. Your Win Streak Bonus will increase the more you play Treasure Battle and win matches consecutively. 
In addition to this, you also can gain a boost in fight money from the treasure chests you recieve in Treasure Battle. While this doesn't always happen, you'll sometimes open a chests that gives you a bunch of fight money instead of an item. With longer games in Treasure Battle mode, you'll see this with common and uncommon chests, especially if you already have a bunch of customization items unlocked. 
Special Battles with bosses that you discover in Treasure Battle will also give you a special bonus in fight money earned when you win. The bonus can range anywhere from an additional 10,000G - 20,000G, depending on the boss defeated and how many victories you have up to that point. 
In every mode of Tekken 7, you gain a bonus of fight money when you achieve a Perfect or Great victory. In Treasure Battle, the bonus fight money you gain is more since you are given bonuses for the Perfect, the amount of health you have left, as well as your Win Streak. 
This is why its well worth giving the extra effort to get a Perfect victory on opponents, even against weak CPU fighters. The more you do this in Treasure Battle, Arcade Mode, and even online; the bigger your profits will be and the closer you'll get to purchase more customization items.

How to Edit Interactive Maps - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Anyone can contribute to the Interactive Maps! Here's how to add your very own map points to the map and link them to pages in the wiki. 
Right-click on the spot where you want to add a map marker. The marker will appear precisely where you clicked on it -- so zoom in really close and click in the right place! You won't be able to move a marker once you save it, but a moderator can. Let a moderator know if you want a marker moved by flagging a page in the wiki (hit FLAG PAGE in the upper left corner and tell us about the mistake). 
After adding your map marker, you'll need to add some information about the marker and link it to an appropriate wiki page (or another map). 
First, add the title, or the name of the page. It's ideal for the marker's title to match the page in the wiki. 
Secondly, you may search for a wiki page to link the map marker to. If the marker marks a collectible location, link to the "index page" for that collectible type (e.g., "Heart Pieces," "Red Coins", "Templar Flags", "Hidden Packages", etc.).

Remember that Central Tower has Guardians at it's base, so be careful when warping there. Also, monsters come out at night so use your paraglider or switch to your Dark Armor Set (Dark Hood, Dark Tunic, and Dark Trousers) so you can run faster.

How to Get Epona - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild features many Wild Horses that Link can tame and rise. Some of which can even be found in Side Quests. 
However, Link's iconic horse, Epona, is missing from the game - but can be obtained through very specific means. 
Before you get too excited, read this whole page first, otherwise you might temporarily miss your shot at keeping Epona. If the player has the Smash Bros. Series Link Amiibo, you can use the Amiibo Rune to tap Link onto the NFC reader (you'll need to turn on Amiibo functionality on the options menu first). While most other Amiibo will summon a supply drop of items - the first time the Smash Bros. Series Link is used, Epona will be summoned instead. 
If Epona does not appear the first time, that means she cannot be summoned in your current area. Go to a place where wild horses can be found and try again (either revert to an earlier save file to try again immediately or wait 24 hours to attempt again). 
Unlike Wild Horses, Epona can be mounted with ease and does not need to be tamed. However, if you wish to keep and ride Epona, then you must register the horse at a stable as soon as possible. If you summon Epona in a place where you cannot get to a Stable, like on the Great Plateau, you will have to wait multiple real-world days to try again, as using the Smash. Bros Series Link Amiibo will only summon standard supply drop items until Epona reappears. 
Also note that Epona cannot be renamed - the stablemasters all know a legendary horse when they see one. Epona will also get a unique saddle and bridle unavailable to other horses that prominently features the triforce emblem.

How to Get Heart Containers - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you will soon find that Heart Pieces (Pieces of Heart) do not exist in Hyrule, and you won't be able to find and increase your hearts by traditional means. 

That's because there aren't any. Instead, you can gain additional Heart Containers by beating each of the four main bosses or by praying to any of the Goddess Statues in the main towns and the Temple of Time. These statues also appear in Kakariko Village, Hateno Village, Zora's Domain, Goron City, Rito Village, and Gerudo Town - and often emit a glow from a distance. 
In exchange for 4 Spirit Orbs gained by completing Shrines, you'll be able to claim either a new Heart Container or Stamina Vessel. 
If the enemies you're fighting seem too tough, or you need to prove your inner power, be sure to go hunting for Shrines to increase your stats.

How to Get the Green Tunic - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are six traditional green tunics in the game. The ones from Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, Wind Waker, and the classic NES Zelda. These can be gained by using their respective Amiibos. 
Simply scan an Amiibo (you have to enable the Amiibo rune in options and then select the rune in-game and aim your marker) and you may get one of these tunics in a random drop. If you don't succeed, try again. 
How to Get the Hylian Shield - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link's Iconic Hylian Shield is hiding in the game somewhere, but is not easy to find - and in fact is one of the most powerful and well hidden items in the game. 
 


Video: How to Get the Hylian Shield

You will find this shield in the depths of the Hyrule Castle Dungeon. The castle itself is a maze of passages and enemies, and this particular area is easily overlooked. 
The best way to reach it is by infiltrating the West side of Hyrule Castle and looking for entrances along the west bank that lead underground. There's one entrance next to the moat by the giant Southwest pillar - with luminous stones growing around it. This leads to a minecart you can use to ride through the West Passage to Lockup. 
You can also find an abandoned raft at the Hyrule Castle Prison West of the Moat, and ride it to the North side of the moat where another entrance lined with luminous stones (and a Rusted Guardian) also leads directly into the Lockup. 
The Hyrule Castle Lockup features a long row of cells where many powerful enemies roam. At the end of the hall you'll find a small passage leading to a circular room beyond that is large - and full of bones. 
In order to claim the Hylian Shield from this place, you must first fight the Stalnox - a skeletal Hinox miniboss that is extremely tough and will use its own bones to attack you with. 
The secret to dealing massive damage to the Stalnox lies in shooting out its eye (preferably with strong attacks like Bomb Arrorws) and chasing it around the room to damage it before the Stalnox grabs its eye and put it back in its socket. 
Use Bomb Arrows to dislodge the eye when he's not covering it with his hand, and use powerful weapons to deal as much damage to the eye as you can. 
When the Stalnox is defeated, a chest will appear containing the iconic Hylian Shield, which boasts extreme durability and a whopping 90 defense. It also has 800 durability - the strongest of any shield by far, and will take many MANY guardian laser blasts to destroy. 
If indeed you do lose the Hylian Shield, fret not - it can be reclaimed. To do so, you must complete the Side Quest - From the Ground Up - where you must help Hudson build Tarrey Town at Lake Akkala in the Akkala Region. If he's not there yet, make sure you buy the house in Hateno to trigger his move. 
Once the quest is complete and Tarrey Town is fully built, a wandering merchant named Grante will appear on the roof of one of the buildings, and will sell you rare unique armor you've found that cannot be bought elsewhere - and this includes the Hylian Shield. Be aware that he only sells one at a time, and it costs 3,000 Rupees to buy a new one!

How to Get the Master Sword - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Master Sword is not easy to come by in Breath of the Wild. No main story point will ever directly lead you to it - and in fact you can complete the game without ever finding it. The Master Sword does not break, but must recharge after use. The Master Sword cannot be thrown -- it instead fires an energy projectile, or beam attack, but only if you have full hearts.

How to Kill Guardians - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Guardians represent one of the toughest foes you'll face in the game, both in the opening hours, and right up to the final end before Ganon. Knowing how they work and how best to defeat them could mean the difference between life and death. 
Guardians come in four types: 
 


Video Guide: 5 Ways to Take Down Guardians
There is also the Guardian Scout, which is found inside Shrine challenges ("Test of Strength). 
In the early game, you'll find that most low-damage weapons cannot even deal any damage at all to Guardians. In fact, the only real weak point they have is their eye - which can be used to your advantage. 
By shooting the eye directly with any arrow - you can guarantee that any type of Guardian will be temporarily stunned as its head spins around trying to shake off the attack. If you find yourself not able to deal damage, stunning them with this method may be your best chance to run away while they recover. 
When you have stronger weapons and armor, it can be more advantageous to stun them with a powerful bow shot to the face, and then move in to attack with melee weapons until they start to re-orient, then move back for another bow shot. Note that while immobile Guardians are easier to hit, regular Guardians and Guardian Skywatchers tend to move around, making things harder. 
You can combat this in two ways - immobilizing them, or slowing down time. Immobilizing is risky but can pay off in a huge way. While stunned, you can attack the legs of a Guardian to hack them off - and if you destroy all legs they'll be unable to move. 
The same goes for Guardian Skywatchers - fire explosive arrows at their propellers, and they'll fall from the sky making them an east target. 
If you want to be fancy, you can look for ways to get up in the air - like updrafts caused from fire - or jumping off your horse. However, doing this you'll need to make sure your shot counts - as you'll likely be out of stamina and horseless when you land. 
Since Guardians have a ton of health - even the Decayed Guardians have 500 HP - you'll need durable and powerful weapons to do the job. Remember that Guardians are most vulnerable to weapons of their time - meaning Ancient Weapons. You can often find these in Shrines, the harder the shrine, the more likely you are to get better Ancient Weapons. You can also buy said weapons by traveling to the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab up in the far Northeast. Here, you can trade in Ancient Parts and Rupees to get weapons of all types, as well as Ancient Armor that resists the damage they deal. 
If you're short on Ancient Parts, consider looting chests in Shrines, or scavenging parts from rusted and abandoned Guardians in locations like the Great Plateau, Fort Hateno, and the dump site behind the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab. 
The single best weapon you can use however is an Ancient Arrow. When fired from a decent bow, a bulls-eye right into the eye of any Guardian will instantly kill it, while a glancing blow will usually deal half of its health in damage. Since these shots are extremely important, using slow motion is best paired with an Ancient Arrow shot - since you'll have a better chance to make sure you land your one hit kill and don't leave yourself open. These arrows can also be purchased at the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab, and a lucky few can be found in chests inside Hyrule Castle.Once you've gotten it, the Master Sword is also extremely effective against Guardians. With the exception of the Scouts found in shrines, being near Guardians turns the Master Sword into its glowing, massively empowered form, allowing you to dismantle ground-bound Guardians with ease. Note, however, that unlike fighting Ganon or his incarnations, this does not remove the sword's durability loss so consider wearing out the Master Sword's durability and waiting out its recharge timer beforehand if you know you're going to be fighting a lot of Guardians. 
Decayed Guardians take only a few hits and need no special strategy. In the case of Stalkers, stun them with an arrow or use the terrain as needed to get close and then start in on the legs. Each one goes down in only two hits, which gives you plenty of time to take out the next leg and extend the stun. Once all the legs are down, hammer away at the main body as fast as possible. You should have just enough time to destroy the Stalker before it fires off its beam but feel free to stun it with another arrow after a few hits and/or use damage boosting effects if you'd prefer to play it safe.Using the Master Sword to destroy all the Guardian Stalkers around Hyrule Castle nets you a good number of ancient parts for absolutely no further investment beyond the difficulty of getting the sword itself. Using these spoils on ancient armor and arrows at the Akkala Ancient Tech lab makes further Guardian kills even easier.

How to Kill Jason - Friday the 13th: The Video Game Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Yes, you can kill Jason in Friday the 13th: The Game. Although you can win matches in many other ways, killing Jason once and for all is an in-depth Easter egg similar to the Call of Duty Zombies map Easter eggs. 
 


The process to complete this may be simple, but remember that doing all these steps will require a lot of coordination with your allies in the match. 
Remember that the Tommy steps can be done at any point, so don't worry about someone having to die until you are getting near the end. The final steps need to all happen very quickly, any hesitation can result in the stun wearing off and the sweater being wasted. 
Have your own tips for killing him or another technique? Let us know down below!

How to Redirect a Page - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
A "redirect" page has no content itself, but sends the reader to another article in the same wiki. Redirects are usually set up to forward misspelled pages or synonymous terms to the proper place. 
For example, an Achievements page may be redirected to an Achievements and Trophies page. Thus, when someone searches for Achievements, or adds double brackets around the word to add a link, the Achievements page one lands on will redirect to the Achievements and Trophies page. 
This practice, called "creating alias pages", is discussed chiefly with Achievement and Trophy pages in mind. 
To add a redirect, you must use the Wiki Markup view of the wiki editor. Enter this editing mode in the upper left edge of the editing window. The syntax code must be the first piece of mark-up on the page: 
This code define the page as a redirect page and indicates the target article. 
Redirects to pages / URLs "outside" of a wiki (for example to another wiki) is not possible at this time. Please use the standard command for creating a hyperlink to link to a page "outside" of the wiki you are currently on (this includes linking to another wiki on IGN).

How to Unlock Secret Characters - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Most of the fighters you cam play as in Tekken 7 are unlocked by default or obtained through downloadable content. However, there are a few additions to the Tekken 7 roster that are fan service and compliments to fighters already on the roster. These secret characters can be unlocked and used once you do a few things in the game during a matchup. 
Here are all of the current known ways to obtain the secret characters in Tekken 7. If you discover any additional ones, feel free to add them to the wiki page! 
Devil Kazuya can be seen during the main story mode towards the finale. While you can't select Devil Kazuya through normal means on the character select screen, you can still play as Devil Kazuya in other game modes. This needs to be done during a match up while playing as Kazuya Mishima. 
Before a match in any mode, select Kazuya Mishima as your character and go into the match as normal. To transform into Devil Kazuya during match, activate the Kazuya's Rage Art by pressing R1 on the controller (RB on Xbox One) or Up+Attack 1 + Attack 2. 
Kazuya will then transform into Devil Kazuya for a short period of time. While transformed, Devil Kazuya is stronger and faster than normal Kazuya. 
While not techincally a separate character that you can use in game, longtime Tekken players will remember Violet from earlier games in the series. You can actually have Lee's outfit changed into Violet's outfit by using the Player 2 outfit. 
You can do this from the Character Select screen by choosing Lee's alternate outfit when you select him, which can be done using Square or Circle on the controller (X or B on the Xbox One Controller). Violet's move set is the exact same as Lee, there are no differences between the two.

How to Upgrade Your Inventory - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Upgrading your inventory in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for weapons, bows, and shields requires plenty of Korok Seeds and the help of the most adorable Korok around, Hestu. 
Hestu will increase your inventory in exchange for Korok Seeds. Pick the category and fork over the seeds. The required amount will increase each time, per category. To find Hestu, you need to complete the side quest "The Priceless Maracas." This quest can be found on the road to Kakariko. Simply defeat the nearby Bokoblin and give Hestu his maracas back. 
Hestu will do a couple of upgrades for you right there before remembering the way home to Korok Forest. He'll set out as soon as you leave to go back home. The catch is that Hestu doesn't make it all the way home. His next stop will be in one of two places. 
He will either go near Riverside Stable, which is west of Kakariko and near Hylia River. If you can't find him there he should be at Woodlands Stable, which is south of Korok Forest along the main road. 
Hestu will do a few more upgrades here before remembering his way home once again. Just like before, hand over a few Korok Seeds for upgrades before Hestu makes the final leg of his journey to Korok Forest where he will permanently reside for the rest of the game.  
You will need to navigate through the Lost Woods to find Korok Forest and make your way to Hestu. From here on out, go to Korok Forest if you want to upgrade your inventory. The Keo Ruug Shrine nearby, which can act as a fast travel point for all your upgrade needs. 
From the Woodland Tower, you can see the large forest is blocked on almost all sides by water. However, trying to climb or glide into the Lost Woods, and you'll be transported away by mysterious laughter. 
To enter the Lost Woods, you must take the path Northeast of the tower and follow the path until the area gets foggy and you arrive at a large ruined arch. 
For these next sections, deviating from the path under any circumstance will result in you being transported back to the last checkpoint - in this case - the large arch. Note that there is a lit torch here, and more farther away set up your path. 
From first torch - head North, North again, then West, West again, then South, and finally look West to spot two Torches in the distance before a large Ogre Tree with a chest in its mouth. 
From two torches, things get more difficult - There are no more torches to guide you, and if you go the wrong way you'll be quickly enveloped in fog and brought back to the torches. If you are quick to react you can escape the fog - but it moves extremely fast. 
In order to find your way, use a torch or any other flammable weapon and light it at the two torches. Stand still and look at the embers flying off the top of the torch. They will be blowing slightly in the direction you need to go. Keep following the embers and you will eventually find your way to the Korok Forest. 
It'll take hundreds of Korok Seeds to max out each inventory category, so make sure to check out our interactive map and guide to find them!

I Am Groot #1 Review - IGN

Now that the core Guardians of the Galaxy comic has gone twice-monthly, do we really need separate solo books for both Rocket Raccoon and Groot? The recent Rocket #1 made a strong case for itself, telling a very different sort of cosmic detective noir/heist tale. That series is clearly telling a story that couldn't be told within All-New Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm not convinced that's the case with I Am Groot #1.
The one advantage with this latest in Marvel's long line of Groot-centric comics is that it has a slight urgency to its status quo. As established in Al-New Guardians, Groot is stuck in his baby form for some reason. Beyond the fact that this puts him in immediate physical danger on any new mission, there's also the ongoing mystery of how and why Groot has become trapped in this infant state. There's little sense that I Am Groot will specifically be exploring that mystery, but at least Groot's new, more precarious state gives the series some sense of novelty.
Mostly, though, this is just the same sort of light, breezy Guardians comic we've seen a great deal of over the past few years. The focus is more on silly antics and crazy visuals than anything, with Groot getting into mischief, discovering a new world and Rocket fretting over his pint-sized BFF. It's all entertaining and about as all-ages friendly as this franchise gets, but there's an annoying sense of familiarity to the whole endeavor. This reads more like a brief detour from the events of All-New Guardians and not the makings of a unique, compelling ongoing series. Given Marvel's recent publishing habits, it may be that the series isn't intended to be ongoing in the first place.

I'm Dying Up Here: "Pilot" Review - IGN

This is a spoiler-free advance review of the first episode of I'm Dying Up Here, which premieres on Showtime on Sunday, June 4. The pilot is also currently available to stream on Showtime's website and YouTube.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single stand-up comedian in possession of a strong sense of humor must be in want of a stable personal life. That's the driving idea behind shows like Louie, and it remains true with I'm Dying Up Here, Showtime's new period dramedy about a group of struggling comics in early '70s Los Angeles. But while there's always an appeal in watching a series that aims to explore the tortured soul that exists the 99% of the week they aren't on-stage, I'm Dying Up Here's heavy ensemble focus proves to be its undoing.
The new series is helmed by creator/writer David Felbottle (Masters of Sex) and based on the nonfiction book by William Knoedelseder. The series is also executive produced by Jim Carrey, who brings to the table his own experiences on the improv and stand-up scene. And with 50/50 and Warm Bodies director Jonathan Levine directing the pilot, I'm Dying Up Here has a pretty impressive comedic pedigree.
That applies to the cast as well. The pilot doesn't focus on any real-life comedians of the era (apart from a small appearance by Johnny Carson, played by Dylan Baker), but rather a group of composite characters loosely based on the real thing. Melissa Leo (Homicide: Life on the Street) stars as Goldie, a hard-edged comedy club owner who either nurtures a community of struggling comedians or exploits them, depending on your point of view. That community includes Southern belle Cassie (Fringe's Ari Graynor), youngster Adam (Me, Earl and the Dying Girl's RJ Cyler), the zany Sully (Happy Endings' Stephen Guarino), Vietnam vet Ralph (Workaholics' Erik Griffin) and veteran comic Bill (Mixology's Andrew Santino). The pilot also focuses a great deal on Boston transplants Ron (Hot Tub Time Machine's Clark Duke) and Eddie (The Knick's Michael Angarano), who quickly discover just how hard it can be to make it in Hollywood.
The pilot features added star power in the form of guest stars Sebastian Stan (Captain America: the Winter Soldier) and Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2). Stan plays Clay Apuzzo, a rising star whose newfound success is a source of delight and jealousy for his friends. Molina plays Carl, a combination mentor/talent manager to Cyler's character. Both actors are easily and rapidly able to rise above the crowded surroundings and establish their respective characters as compelling players in the unglamorous world of stand-up comedy. Stan's Clay in particular is captivating as a man who seems surprisingly unhappy about having reached the pinnacle of his chosen profession.
Trim a few faces from this crowd and you have a better show.
Basically, there are a lot of names and faces to keep track of in this first episode, and even with the run-time clocking in at almost exactly one hour, this episode doesn't do a great job of establishing the main cast. Too many characters can be summed up with the same phrase - "struggling stand-up comic." Too many characters tend to blur together after a while. It doesn't help that so many of the stand-up routines in this episode are similar in style and delivery. There's a lot of observational humor and riffs on topics of the day - Roe v. Wade, Vietnam, etc. Granted, you can't really expect groundbreaking humor from a show set over 40 years in the past. But the truth is that the characters are often more funny and entertaining in their downtime, whether blowing off steam at a local diner, butting heads with Goldie or simply wallowing in the poverty-fueled misery of their lives.
To the show's credit, there's not a bad performance in the bunch here. It's merely a question of space. I'm Dying Up Here would have been better served with a more streamlined approach, one that jettisoned a few of the excess struggling comedians and maintained focus on three storylines - those of Cassie, Adam and the Ron/Eddie duo. Those are the three plot threads that do stand out in this first episode. Cassie's and Adam's career ambitions carry extra weight, as the former frequently deals with sexist hecklers and the latter gets sucked into some very shady dealings. Cassie's battle to hone her voice also results in the one truly memorable stand-up performance in this first episode, as her happy-go-lucky facade briefly cracks as she works through a profound personal tragedy in the middle of her act. Scenes like that are a strong showcase for what the series could be after it works through its early hurdles.
An over-large cast isn't the only problem to confront, however. The general tone feels a little out-of-whack, making occasional plunges into dark territory that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the episode. That's especially true with Adam's struggles. The episode takes a sudden, bizarre detour into Boogie Nights territory that really doesn't feel earned this early into proceedings. There's a frequent clash between good-natured nostalgia for the era and the emphasis on the grimy, seedy underbelly of showbiz.
The series also seems a little too eager to flaunt its period setting. Felbottle and Levine seem intent on reminding viewers in every single frame that the show is taking place in 1973. Nearly every scene is drenched in a hazy golden filter. Most of the costumes feel more like exaggerated parodies of '70s attire, with plenty of polyester suits, bell bottoms and long, unkempt hair to go around. In more ways than one, I'm Dying Up Here tries harder than necessary.
I'm Dying Up Here shows plenty of promise in its first episode. The cast is strong, even if the stand-up humor is pretty formulaic. The show's biggest problem is simply the excess of characters. With a more streamlined approach and a more balanced tone, this series might just succeed in exploring the tortured private lives of these aspiring comedians.

Impa - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story

Impa is a recurring character in The Legend of Zelda and appears in this game as well. Impa is princess Zelda's nurse and is sent by her to get Din, in Holodrum, and to bring her back with her to Hyrule. To do this she becomes the cook for Din's group of performers. 
When Onox captures Din she tells Link to save Holodrum and restore the seasons. She also tells Link to go and visit the Maku Tree. From this point onwards you can find her in a tree just north of Horon Village. 
Impa, like the Maku Tree, is very useful because she'll give you hints on where the next dungeon is. Furthermore they're usually much more straightforward than the Maku Tree's. So if you're stuck you can go and find Impa.

Introduction - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
  EditIntroduction  
Inventory - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There is a wide arsenal of inventory when playing Breath of the Wild, and more so than any previous game in Zelda history in fact. Between the wide selection of bows, shields, spears and swords, you're bound to find something that fits your style of play. 
Just be careful not to overuse even the fanciest of weaponry, as this time you'll literally break even the mightiest of blades if given the chance - and with very little in terms of exceptions, as only one particular sword is too important to fail thereby having a different effect if overused. Additionally, only a minuscule subset of inventory can be restored upon breakage (and these are the hardest to come by, requiring enough dedication to actually progress the plot as they are tied to Link's past and the champions who came before). 
There's also a bigger selection of armor pieces than anything Link has ever seen before, many with super-special effects for super-specific situations. Only a small set is available to purchase outright, as well - others need to be earned by completing quests or conquering challenge trials in the many shrines dotting the landscape. These are also the only truly-customizable parts of your inventory aside from the wide assortment of meals that you cook up to replenish your hearts, whether you opt to dye them (provided that you have the right to do so as not all types of armor are eligible) or simply increase their stats by interacting with the four Great Fairies residing in the most remote corners of Hyrule.

Is Terraria the Next Minecraft? - IGN

I follow the torch-lit path down, down, down. And then down some more, swinging my trusty flaming sword to slaughter the occasional demonic adversary as I descended. How much bigger could this map be? And what will I find when I get there?
James Cameron on Bringing Avatar to Life at Disney World and the Wait for the Sequels - IGN

James Cameron has big, big plans for Avatar, as he gets ready to begin shooting four sequels that will follow up the story told in the 2009 film - which is still the highest-grossing movie ever released. But that's hardly all that's going on for Avatar, as this past weekend saw the opening of Pandora: The World of Avatar, an entire themed land at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom that is based around the film.
At the opening event for Pandora, I spoke to Cameron about this massive undertaking, which includes an incredibly impressive ride, Flight of Passage. We also discussed how the theme park can help his cast, as they prepare to film the sequels, and whether he's concerned over how long it will take for the first follow-up to open.
IGN: You got to sort of dip your toe into the theme park world with T2 3-D: Battle Across Time at Universal many years ago, but getting to be a part of creating this entire Pandora land, is it kind of a dream come true to see your vision come to life like this?

iZombie Preview: When Liv's a Hot Mess, Even Cadavers Are in Trouble - IGN

In each episode of iZombie, part of the fun is seeing what new brain Liv (Rose McIver) consumes, and what traits she takes on as a result. This week, Liv finds herself on "hot mess brain" and the results aren't pretty. A clubbing, self-obsessed, disorganized, scatter-brained wannabe DJ, the victim here is not exactly an upgrade for Liv.
Check out IGN's exclusive clip from "Some Like it Hot Mess," as Ravi (Rahul Kohl) learns just how much Liv's new persona is interfering with her job - and the corpses it involves.
Previewing this episode with IGN, iZombie co-creator/executive producer Rob Thomas said, "Rose, as she often does -- but this one I particularly enjoyed -- has so many winning, unscripted moments. Just looks that she gives that are so great. We kinda knew she would be good on this one."

Link - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The hero Link is one of the confirmed characters in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Little is known about the game at this time, and more information will be added as it is revealed. 
Although bearing a heavy resemblance to Link, Eiji Aonuma stated that the character in the trailer may not be Link. Eiji Aonuma would eventually admit that the character was, in fact, Link. 
With the reveal of the supposed start of the game at E3 2016, little is known about our protagonist. Link has been asleep for 100 years, in a strange looking tomb of old technology. 
He awakens to hear the voice of Zelda beckoning him to open his eyes and save the land, to restore Hyrule. Exactly why Link was sleeping and where on the timelines this places Link is still a mystery.

Loyalty Missions - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on the optional Loyalty Missions in Mass Effect Andromeda. 
 


Loyalty Missions, originally introduced in Mass Effect 2, are returning in Andromeda. These missions are intended to not only increase a particular squadmate's rapport with Ryder, but also add additional narrative information and context for their inclusion in the main story. Unlike the loyalty missions of Mass Effect 2, however, players will not be severely punished for skipping over these missions. 
In Mass Effect Andromeda, Loyalty Missions are unlocked after completing the main story mission Hunting the Archon. Certain characters also require that additional tasks be completed before a Loyalty Mission is unlocked. The requirements for unlocking each character's loyalty missions are listed below. 
After investigating the Asari signal on Voeld during the quest Cora Harper: Asari Ark, Cora will begin attempting to recover data from a Kett transponder. Once the Tempest crew completes Hunting the Archon, her work will be completed - she then asks Ryder to accompany her to the Asari ark to rescue their Pathfinder and their people. 
After discovering the nefarious plot against the Krogan in Drack's character mission Krogan Betrayal, and returning to the Tempest after Hunting the Archon, Drax informs you that the Krogan Seed Vault - lifeline for the species - has been reported stolen on Elaaden. Accompany him to the desert world, find out where it is and recover it. 
After completing Hunting the Archon, Vetra will inform Ryder that she's received an emergency signal from her little sister, Sid. The signal reveals that Sid has a lead on some missing settlers on H-047c. Accompany Vetra to the abandoned mining facility to assist. 
After several character missions that involve helping Peebee track down parts for her Remnant VI project, but after finding the final piece, wouldn't ya' know, it ends up getting stolen. Track down the thieves and help Peebee reclaim her opus. 
Once Ryder completes the Character Mission Armor Diplomacy successfully establishes at least three Initative Outposts on various planets in the Heleus Cluster, Liam's Loyalty Mission becomes available. 
To initiate Jaal's Loyalty Mission, Ryder must first complete the Character Mission Friend or Foe, then speak with Jaal following the completion of the quest Hunting the Archon. 
Once these requirements have been met, read the email that Jaal sends and speak to him in the Tempest's tech lab - he will recruit your aid in preventing the isolationist Roekaar faction of the Angara from gaining controlling power over his people.

Major Choices - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page catalogues the consequences of the many important decisions that Ryder will have to make during their adventure as Pathfinder in the Heleus Cluster. 
This is the first important choice Ryder will have to make on their journey - whether to turn the Prodromos outpost on Eos into a peaceful community dedicated to scientific research, or a well-stocked military outpost that serves as a forward operating base to the system. 
The consequences of this decision are not far-reaching, but send an important message to both the colonists of the Andromeda Initiative and any native species who may be watching about what the intentions of Milky Way settlers may be in this galaxy. 
After rescuing the Angaran Moshae, Ryder must decide whether or not to destroy the Kett processing facility or to take the time to rescue the Angaran prisoners before the Kett re-take the base. 
This decision will result in the death of many Angarans - though how Angaran they still are may be debatable - and Ryder's choice will affect how many people view them as a leader. 
If the facility is destroyed, Jaal is upset with Ryder for not preventing avoidable deaths; however the Moshae is grateful that Ryder acted decisively and eliminated this threat to her people. 
Conversely, if Ryder opts to attempt a rescue for the Angaran prisoners, Jaal is glad for this outcome and the Moshae is upset. She threatens not the allow Ryder into Aya's vault, but eventually concedes after admitting it would be an irrational decision.

Making Links - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
If you're familiar with editing other wikis (such as Wikipedia), you may be familiar with in-line linking or creating a hyperlink to another wiki or page. For IGN's wikis, there are two types of links: internal hyperlinks (pages in a single wiki) and external hyperlinks (a page or URL that exists outside a wiki - this includes another wiki on IGN). 
Links from one page to another in the same wiki (not two different wikis) are created by simply entering the exact name (down to capitalization - IGN uses Chicago Style for capitalizing page titles) of the page being linked to. 
Simply click on the "Link" button (it is right of the three text alignment buttons) and a hyperlink pop-up will appear. Input the destination page and press ENTER or click the OK button. 
In the wiki-code editor, you create internal link with double-brackets --- 
. Capitalization and spelling count; additionally, underscores are treated as empty spaces (and vice versa). For IGN, it is preferable to use empty spaces instead of underscores. 
Remember that when creating internal links to pages (existing pages or placeholders), keep Invalid Page Punctuation in mind. 
Using this method, you can easily create placeholders for future pages on existing pages. To find these "empty" linked-to pages, you can use the Wanted Pages link in the Wiki Tools section of the navigation box to identify all such pages. 
External links are created in the same manner, except the entire URL is pasted into the hyperlink pop-up. In the wiki-code editor, single-brackets are used in this syntax --- 
--- That code creates this link: IGN Entertainment 
The staff refrains from using this except when citing sources, or linking to a resource that exists outside the current wiki. The reason for this is that a wiki will naturally collect all hyperlinks on a page at the bottom of each page. If there are too many external links, a page will be closely scrutinized and edited. 
Anchor links allow you to jump between sections all while on a page, or jump to a section on another page. An example for this page would look like this: 
This would immediately jump you to the section for the Anchor Link Test (below) on the page. Underscores must be included for it to work for sections with multiple words. 
Try it it out: Jump to Test Link 
With this, you can build a very nice Table of Contents at the top of long pages to point out the highlights. 
It is even possible to add links to sections on other pages. To do that, the code would look something like this: 
If linking to anchor link externally, or from another page, just append the section header, with underscores and a #, to a URL: 
Try it it out: http://www.ign.com/wikis/how-to/Making_Links#Anchor_Link_Test 
When direct-linking terms from the nav or within page copy, you may find it necessary to point multiple terms to the same url (eg, plural or singular keyword). To do this, you can create multiple pages and simply redirect the duplicates to the original one. 
Simply enter that text with the relevant page name as wiki markup on an empty page to redirect it. 
Well, hi there! Congrats on a successful anchor link test!

Marvel's Agents of SHIELD Clip: Will Daisy Have to Abandon a Friend in the Framework?  - IGN

On the last episode of Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, we learned that Aida was attempting to build herself a human form so that she could finally overcome her programming to protect humanity.

In this exclusive scene from the episode, the two of them realize that it may be impossible to save everyone as one of their close friends, within the Framework, is still a top Hydra operative. Take a look!
The official synopsis for "Farewell, Cruel World!" reads:
"Daisy and Simmons rush to get the team out of the Framework, but not everyone is ready and willing to leave."
Marvel's Agents of SHIELD airs Tuesdays at 10/9c on ABC.

Marvel's Agents of SHIELD: Season 4 Review - IGN

Full spoilers for Marvel's Agents of SHIELD continue below.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
With its fourth season, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD is the best it's ever been, maturing as a show and learning the right lessons from what's come before.
Network scheduling shifts prompted some of the best creative changes for the series, with its move back to 10 p.m. allowing for darker tones and story material, and multiple breaks throughout the year inspiring the writers to lean into a three-pod format. Because of those two key changes, Agents of SHIELD was able to dig deeper into its introduction of Ghost Rider and exploration of artificial intelligence, to successful results.
Season 4 was broken into three pods tied together by the central plot device of the Darkhold: "Ghost Rider," which introduced Robbie Reyes and his conflict with his Uncle Eli; "L.M.D.," which saw Radcliffe and AIDA's experiments with artificial intelligence take a dark turn when the Darkhold became involved; and "Agents of Hydra," which threw SHIELD's agents into an alternate reality that they needed to escape. Each was more successful than the pod that came before, with the arrival in the Framework being the strongest arc of the season.
The pod format helped tighten the season and give it a stronger throughline; while Agents of SHIELD tends to do a great job sticking its respective premieres/finales (and midseason premieres/finales), it sometimes gets lost in the stretches of episodes in between as it attempts to keep the momentum of the season up and keep the audience guessing. Having less time between each big shift in the season made for a tighter story overall.
Agents of SHIELD has always been a science-based show, so incorporating magic and the supernatural into the series in the form of Robbie Reyes' Ghost Rider was a bit of a gamble going in. While the science-based storylines that came later in the season still were stronger, the inclusion of the Ghost Rider character stuck the landing, largely because of Gabriel Luna's excellent performance and the great CGI work from Mark Kolpack and his team.
Though Ghost Rider looked good and was an effective character, some other elements of this arc weren't as strong. The Darkhold-affected ghostly scientists didn't look great and Eli wasn't a particularly standout villain. But if that's the cost of getting Robbie into the MCU, then so be it; here's hoping he'll return in future seasons as well.
Though Ghost Rider's introduction was trumpeted as the standout new character of Season 4, it was Mallory Jansen's AIDA that was the season's MVP. All of the guest stars -- from Luna and Natalie Cordova to John Hannah and Jason O'Mara -- were stellar, but Jansen, in particular, stole the show. The conversation about the rights and wrongs of creating artificial intelligence have been explored time and again in pop culture, but the way Jansen humanized AIDA from conception to villainzation and back again made the character and the storyline work.

McDonald's Introduces the Frork, a Fork With Fries For Prongs - IGN

Biting down on your fork never tasted so good. Or good at all. Generally speaking, it's mildly to moderately uncomfortable to bite down on your fork, but fast food restaurant McDonald's has found a solution.
Instead of cold, hard metal, or cold, somewhat less-hard, plastic, McDonald's has replaced the prongs of the traditional fork with hot, salty french fries, and called the mash-up a Frork.
Its new Frork is the sort of disruptive technology normally reserved for bloated Silicon Valley tech start-ups. Instead of seeking seed capital from angel investors, McDonald's new Frork instead seeks flavor drippings from the fast food maker's new line of Signature Crafted Recipes.
In a mock infomercial for the new Frork, we're shown its many uses in sopping up the sauces on McDonald's newest line of hamburgers, including Pico Guacamole, Sweet BBQ Bacon and Maple Bacon Dijon. All that flavor goo is bound to escape the confines of the bun in the course of consumption, and rather than let it sit there, unconsumed, on your plate, the Frork helps your dab up every last bit of it.
Ultimately, though, it's just a funny little piece of McDonald-land you can add to your collection, right next to the Super Mario McDonald's Happy Meal toys out right now. You can get your own Frork when McDonald's launches its new sandwich line May 5, or you can call the 800-number in the infomercial to land yourself a Frork or a free coupon to try one of its Signature Crafted Recipes.
If you do manage to score one, let's us know you've been Frorked in the comments.

Mementos and Requests - Persona 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The following is IGN's guide to Mementos and Requests that can be done inside of it in Persona 5. 
Requests are usually obtained through the Phansite and sent to you by Mishima. These requests have you go into Mementos and track down lesser Shadows who are causing problems for people without being so distorted that they create Palaces. 
Some requests are also obtained through Confidants and they will be listed separately. 
To start, requests have you go into Mementos. Mementos is made up of eight different areas and each area opens up to you after you beat a Palace. 
The letters in parentheses beside the path names are what we will use to indicate request locations below. For example, the first request in the list below is on the Path of Qimranut: Area 1, but we've shortened that to Q:1. 
What comes below the final floor of Mementos can be discovered through the story. 
Requests have a strange quirk to them, though. The Shadow you face during them does not have the same weaknesses (if any) as the Shadow it looks like. For example, if you fight a Shadow that looks like Jack Frost, which should have a weakness to Fire and a resistance to Ice, it probably won't have those. The Shadow's appearance is purely an aesthetic choice. 
The following are regular requests that you'll get throughout the game. Make sure to read Mishima's texts in order to unlock them. 
Memories - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a new type of collectible are Memories that Link can obtain in his journeys. After speaking to Purah in Hateno Town during the Locked Mementos Quest, you'll learn from Impa that Princess Zelda took several pictures in the Sheikah Slate, and each location is tied to your memories of her. Finding each location is necessary in order to complete the (completely optional) Captured Memories main quest. 
 


Memory 1 - Subdued Ceremony - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Memory 1 - Subdued Ceremony is one of 19 unlockable Memories in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
In order to find and view Memories, you must search for the locations based on the visual clues in your Sheikah Slate Album. Upon arriving at the correct destination, you'll find a glowing spot that will trigger the memory, unlocking it for you. 
The photo in question shows a location in Central Hyrule not far from Hyrule Castle itself. In fact, the location is just South of the castle, located in the spot known as the Sacred Ground Ruins, where a small pool of water surrounds a dais now patrolled by a Guardian. So long as you are quick and quiet, you should be able to reach the site of the memory in the center to trigger the flashback.

Memory 2 - Revali's Flap - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Memory 2 - Revali's Flap is one of 19 unlockable Memories in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
In order to find and view Main Quest Memories, you must unlock them by journeying to the specific place and unlocking a crucial story moment. 
This memory - not attatched to Princess Zelda, can be obtained during the main quest - Divine Beast Vah Medoh. After speaking to the Elder of Rito Village, talk to Temba's wife in the next building who will point out the landing platform. This will trigger Link's memory of the champion Revali.

Minibosses - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Minibosses are tough monsters in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild who appear at specific locations in the giant map of Hyrule. You'll know you're fighting a Miniboss when the name of the boss appears at the top of the screen, along with its health meter. Plus, each boss gets its own music and appears in various locations and forms throughout Hyrule. 
This massive monster swims beneath the desert's sand. It spends most of its time submerged, but if it senses sound, it will breach the surface to feast on whatever it can grab.

Missing Arks - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains information on the missing arks that can be found throughout Mass Effect: Andromeda. 
In addition to Ark Hyperion, which house the majority of the Human population traveling to the Heleus Cluster, there were also three other ark ships that were supposed to rendezvous with the Nexus upon arrival. 
There was Ark Natanus, the Turian ark, Ark Leusinia for the Asari, and the Salaria ark Paarchero. 
Sadly Hyperion was the only ark to return to the Nexus, more than a year overdue itself. Ryder can endeavor to find these missing arks if they so choose.

May Free Xbox Games With Gold Announced - IGN

May's line-up of free Xbox One and Xbox 360 games for Gold subscribers has been announced.
The full lineup, plus when they'll be available, is:
Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a surprisingly challenging 2D puzzle-platformer, while Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is an isometric shooter spin-off we gave an 8.1 and said is "almost as essential as Lara's third-person excursions."
360 gets a Star Wars-themed month, perhaps to coincide with the recent Last Jedi trailer and Battlefront 2 reveal. The Force Unleashed 2 was, by our reckoning, "fails to tell an interesting yarn, but also somehow manages to make the cool combat mechanics feel relatively pedestrian".
Luckily, Lego Star Wars is a better proposition - we gave it an 8.0, saying "if you've waited until now to try Lego Star Wars, this is definitely the game to buy".
As always, both 360 games will be available to play on Xbox One via backward compatibility, and April Game with Gold, The Walking Dead: Season 2 will still be available on Xbox One until May 15.

Multiplayer - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Mass Effect: Andromeda's main multiplayer is a wave-based team shooter that features various objectives and three enemy types. Selecting Quick Match and choosing your difficulty (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Random) will put you in a match with others on one of five maps against the kett, Remnant, or outlaws. Your team is then challenged to survive seven waves of various missions. 
Below you'll find tips for the multiplayer along with catalogued information of the store and character options. Scroll to the bottom of the page for information on how to earn free mission funds. 
 


Make sure to customize your loadout. For faster recharge times on your abilities you can select lighter weapons like a pistol / assault rifle combo. The base Avenger / Predator will give you a 100% recharge speed, but a sniper rifle like the viper and the predator pistol for example will give you a 25% penalty meaning you can use your abilities less often. 
When your character levels up don't neglect passive skills. These are the last two abilities in the menu, and while they're not as flashy as the other skills, they'll help you survive longer and be more proficient in combat. 
Add mods if you have them! Your mods are account wide so you can apply them to each of your weapons if they're available. 
Murder on the Orient Express: How Kenneth Branagh Recreated the Legendary Train and Reimagined the Agatha Christie Classic - IGN

20th Century Fox held a promotional tour in Europe in early May for their star-studded retelling of Agatha Christie's classic whodunit Murder on the Orient Express, which opens in November. IGN was among the select media outlets invited to ride aboard the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express with cast member Josh Gad (see my interview with him aboard it below) from Venice to Paris before venturing on to London to watch roughly 15 minutes of unfinished footage from the Kenneth Branagh-directed film.
My Hero Academia Episode 23: "Shoto Todoroki: Origin" Review - IGN

Warning: Full spoilers for the episode below.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
To say my expectations were high going into "Shoto Todoroki: Origin" would be an understatement. Season 2 has been building up to Deku's fight against Todoroki ever since the Sports Festival began, raising the bar to what I feared was unachievable heights. However, thanks to the brilliantly delivered backstory of Todoroki, coupled with Deku's selfless actions to help his friend break free from the shackles of his past, "Shoto Todoroki: Origin" surpassed my lofty expectations and now stands as My Hero Academia's finest episode and quite possibly the best 24 minutes of television I've seen all year.
Todoroki's acceptance of the entirety of himself, and Deku's aid in getting him to that point of realization, is unquestionably the strongest aspect of this episode. Despite it being out of a desire to rebel against his abusive father, Todoroki's rejection of his flame Quirk is destroying him, both emotionally and physically. I love the way this is illustrated in their fight, as Todoroki's unwillingness to use his fiery half results in his body starting to freeze over.
Deku pleads with Todoroki to accept his fire Quirk
In an effort to reject his father, Todoroki was actually rejecting half of himself. Deku, well aware of this fact, helps Todoroki realize he is not Endeavor and how embracing the Quirk he inherited from his father doesn't mean he will become the abusive man that raised him. While Todoroki labels his fire quirk as "my old man's power," Deku challenges that notion by delivering an incredibly impactful line that cut right to the heart of the matter, saying, "It's your power, isn't it?"
While Season 2 has already done an excellent job at making me sympathize for Todoroki, "Shoto Todoroki: Origin" takes it to a whole new level. The harrowing flashback scenes where we get a horrifying glimpse at the emotional and physical damage Endeavor has inflicted upon his family were brilliantly executed. My heart broke for young Todoroki when his father interrupted his son's longing gaze to drag him away from his siblings while they laughed and played, telling him they live in a different world than his own. Having the opportunity to see his not-yet-scarred face knowing what was to come, made these brief glimpses into Todoroki's past all the more tense and emotional, and when that fateful moment finally does arrive, it's every bit as impactful as I could have expected.
Young Todoroki, emotionally broken by his father's abuse
The desperate and crazed look on Todoroki's mother's face as she stood over the kettle of boiling water she would ultimately pour on Todoroki's face is an image I won't soon forget. That sequence, which is expertly placed between Deku's passionate pleas with his friend to accept his fiery half, is an incredible encapsulation of the horrors of domestic abuse and the ripple effect it has throughout a family and one's life. Even Todoroki's mother, who clearly loves her son and assured him that it was okay for him to pursue his dreams of becoming a hero, buckled under the weight of her husband's abuse.

Originally released for the Famicom Disk System in Japan, the game arrived in the US on cartridge in 1987. In an ingenious marketing ploy, Nintendo released the game on a gold cartridge, so if you hadn't heard about the glory of Zelda, the shiny cart would definitely catch your attention. And since Zelda originated on the Disk System, the US version also included the ability to save your game status via battery back-up -- a first for the NES. The game's release heralded the end of the days when console games were all about linear quests and never-ending twitch gameplay with small level variations or increasing speed settings.

New to Netflix for June 2017 - IGN

Netflix in June features the return of Orange is the New Black - which looks like it might be getting even darker now that Emmy rules prohibit it from getting a nomination as a "Comedy" now.
And speaking of Orange, that show's creator, Jenji Kohan, has executive produced a new Netflix series called GLOW - about the cult '80s women's wrestling series, starring Alison Brie and Ellen Wong. That's also on the slate for June.
You'll also get to see, thanks to that CW/Netflix deal, new seasons of Arrow and The 100 (and presumedly The Flash too) as they'll arrive shortly after the season finale dust settles. There's also Zodiac, Full Metal Jacket, My Left Foot, The Sixth Sense, and Netflix Originals like The Ranch and Flaked.
Also, thanks to Disney's deal with Netflix, the House of Mouse's movies show up on Netflix a lot sooner these days. Hence, being able to catch Moana mid-June, just six months after it opened in theaters.

'No Plans' for Destiny 2 on Nintendo Switch - IGN

Destiny may have made the jump to PC, but it's unlikely to complete the platform quartet with a Nintendo Switch version.
Speaking to IGN at Destiny 2's gameplay reveal event, project lead Mark Noseworthy initially said that Bungie has "no announcements to make about the Switch at this time".
When asked if that meant the franchise could embrace Switch in some way in the future, Noseworthy added:
Normal Items - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
ShovelThe Shovel is used to dig up earth and break some soft boulders. Use it in the same way as the Sword to find power-ups and Rupees. 
BombsBombs will help you access new places in the world. By putting a Bomb down next to a brittle wall, you can open new areas. Bombs can also be used as weapons. Simply equip them to a hand, press the corresponding button to arm one, then press it again (and push the D-Pad toward your target) to throw. Watch out, though. Hanging on to a Bomb too long is hazardous to your health. 
FlutesFlutes can be used to call animal helpers when you are in a jam. Moosh, Ricky, and Dmitri each have their own that they will bestow on you when the time is right. You will only get one per quest, though. 
Seed SatchelThe Seed Satchel is indispensible, as it allows you to carry all the handy Seeds you'll need throughout your quest. To equip a specific type of Seed, select the Satchel from your inventory, then choose your Seed from the kinds currently available. Eventually, the Satchel will hold all five types of Seeds.  
Roc's FeatherRoc's Feather will allow you to jump one space horizontally. This gives you more access to special areas of the game, helps to complete puzzles and avoid enemy attacks. Later, when you get Pegasus Seeds, use the Feather in combination to leap even further. 
Zora's FlippersZora's Flippers will allow you to swim in shallow water; certainly nothing as deep as the ocean. To swim, press A. To dive to avoid an attack or access a deeper area, press B. 
Magic PotionMagic Potions are quite rare and very valuable. If a Magic Potion is in your inventory and your hero falls dead, he will be resurrected and all of his Hearts will be replaced. There are only three ways to get a Magic Potion: either you have to run into (literally) the young witch Maple, or visit her mentor Syrup's Shop. If you run into Maple and she drops a Potion, try to grab it at all costs. Buying it in Syrup's Shop will cost you 300 Rupees. You can also get it from a Gasha Seed, but it is extremely rare. 
Power BraceletWhen Link wears the Power Bracelet, he becomes able to lift heavy objects like vases and bushes. In addition, he can pull special levers in dungeons. When wearing the Power Bracelet, he can also throw whatever he's holding.

Okumura's Spaceport - Persona 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The following is IGN's walkthrough to the fifth Palace in Persona 5, Okumura's Spaceport. 
You are free to start exploring this Palace starting 9/19 and your deadline is October 11. 
The following Personas are available in this Palace: Scathach (Priestess), Arahabaki (Hermit), Lilim (Devil), Belphegor (Tower), Kaiwan (Star), Black Ooze (Moon), Mothman (Moon), Girimehkala (Moon), Mithras (Sun) 
 


You can clear this Palace in a single day. Because of this, infiltrate the Palace for the first time no later than October 8th so that you can send the calling card on the 9th and steal his heart on the 10th. 
When you're ready, gather your team and make your way into the Palace. Haru is unable to fight alongside you for now since the full power of her Persona has yet to be unlocked. She will, however, be able to utilise the biometric scanner for you. 
This is where you start inside the Palace. Head over to the lift and head down when you're ready to start. 
Take the same route as you did before to get to the biometric scanner. This time, though, there will be Shadows along the way, so prepare to fight or sneak at your own accord.

Organizing the Navigation - How To Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The navigation box of a wiki may be edited by using the "Edit Nav" link on the bottom of the wiki's navigation box. From there, you may change the organization of existing pages, link to pages you've created, or make "placeholder" pages for future pages. 
In terms of organization, IGN staff prefers creating the navigation of a wiki first, then adding content to the sections afterward. After all, good content is useless if readers cannot find it. 
So for example, if you know the names of all the missions in a wiki's walkthrough, you may create placeholder pages for those missions under a "walkthrough" section on a wiki. Once you've played through the mission, or have your video(s) ready, you can write stuff on the page (or embed your video). 
Don't forget that after adding a page (placeholder or not) with the navigation editor, save your changes or you won't have the latest changes to the navigation saved. 
IGN's wikis uses a three-tier hierarchy for ordering pages. The tiers go from "broad" to "specific", from left to right. So an example would be:  
When editing the navigation box, you must highlight a "broad" topic before you can add "subordinate" pages and sections to the center and right colums. Remember, when you edit a page's name in the navigation, you are creating a placeholder page if the name of that page doesn't exist.  
Additionally, some symbols and punctuation are disallowed on the wikis. Refer to the Invalid Page Punctuation page for more details.

Orphan Black Final Season Sneak Peek: Sarah and Mika Switch Places - IGN

The final season of Orphan Black is debuting soon and we've got an exclusive clip from Season 5 - once more showing off the formidable talent of both Tatiana Maslany and the show's special effect team when it comes to creating the clones at the center of the series.
In the following scene, Sarah (Maslany) and Mika (also Maslany) need to make a very quick switch up and pose as one another, as part of Sarah's quest to get back her daughter, Kira. Take note of the fact that the scene is all done in one shot, swiftly panning around the room -- and the two Maslanys -- in a fascinating technical feat.
Orphan Black: Season 5 debuts June 10th on BBC America.

Partners - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Over the course of Link's adventure in Labrynna he will meet three animal companions who in return for rescuing them will offer their services to him in helping him travel throughout the land. There is Ricky the Boxing Kangaroo, Dimitri the Dodango, and Moosh, a flying bear. Each has their own form of traveling as well as attacking. You will first meet the three at different points and afterwards have the oppurtunity to add one of them as a permanent partner for the rest of the game. Which will become your partner will all depend on whether you have an item known as the Strange Horn (it also depends where you recieve this item). The Strange Horn will allow you to summon whichever of the three becomes your partner. 
The Strange Flute is an item that appears in both The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons. In each game, there are two ways to obtain the Strange Flute; each way yields a different animal companion. 
Note: It is advised the player chooses the partner they wish to have in the beginning of the game and get the Strange Flute according to the partner the player wants. If Link fails to get the Strange Flute before meeting the default partner, there is no way to choose one of the other two. 
In Oracle of Seasons, the first way to get the Strange Flute is by buying it from the shop in Horon Village for 150 Rupees. The second way to receive the Strange Flute is by dancing in the Subrosian Dance Hall; however, if Link has not received the Boomerang, he will receive it before he gets any other prize, including the Flute.  
Also in Linked Games whoever you end up with will also be your partner in the next game. Below is a list of the three detailing where you meet them, their abilites, and the criteria for adding them as your permanent companion. 
Below are the links to the available partners to choose:

                                                The Surge is an action-RPG that features innovative combat mechanics and an original character progression system based on modular upgrades gained through tight, visceral combat. Set in a heavily dystopian future as Earth nears the end of its life, those who remain in the overpopulated cities must work to survive as social programs become saturated by an ageing population and increasing environmental diseases. As the intelligence of technology incrementally increased over the years, many jobs for the human race had been made redundant, forcing Earth's citizens to head out into the suburbs seeking labor, aided by exoskeletons to improve their efficiency. The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.

Shadow of War expands on the Nemesis System with the introduction of Followers who bring about entirely new stories of loyalty, betrayal and revenge.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Has Franchise's Second-Lowest Domestic Debut, But Shows Promise Overseas - IGN

While Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales topped the box office in its domestic debut, its estimated three-day weekend earnings of $62.2 million make it the second-lowest debut in the history of the franchise.
The film is projected to make approximately $76 million over the four-day weekend, which includes estimated earnings up through Memorial Day. While the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's performance has been waning domestically, the series has grown in popularity overseas. In fact, the series' fourth entry, On Stranger Tides, is the franchise's highest-grossing installment internationally with $804.6 million, despite it being the first Pirates film that failed to crack $300 million domestically.
As such, it stands to reason that Dead Men Tell No Tales could end up recouping its $230 million production budget (not including marketing costs) and end up being a hit for Disney, so long as the film performs well enough internationally. So far, the film has made an estimated $208.3 million abroad, which makes it the twelfth biggest opening overseas ever, but still trailing behind both On Stranger Tides and At World's End, which debuted to a whopping $260.4 million and $216 million, respectively. Dead Men Tell No Tales' worldwide opening three-day weekend total stands at an estimated $270.6 million.

Heleus Cluster and Galaxy Map Guide - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Heleus Cluster is the location within the Andromeda Galaxy that The Initiative selected as its initial base of operations for it's Milky Way pioneers. 
There are many stars to visit in the Cluster, and each has its own system of planets and moons to explore. Here you will find a catalogue of each planet. 
The Zheng He system is where Ryder initially begins their adventure after completing the prologue and reaching the Nexus. There are four additional planets to explore, as well as an anomaly to discover. 
The Pfeiffer bridges the Nexus and the colony on Eos, between the Zheng He and Pytheas systems. This system also offers the best vantage point from which to study the massive black hole at the center of the Cluster. 
This solar system is home to Eos, the Andromeda Initiative's first attempted colony outside the Milky Way galaxy. 
The Eriksson system, likely named for 11th century viking explorer Lief, is where Ark Hyperion first emerged in the Heleus Cluster. 
Onaon is part of the second group of planets that Ryder visits, and is home to the secret Angaran stronghold on Aya. 
Faroang is another in the second group of systems that Ryder visits, and is the location of the ancestral homeworld of the Angaran people, Havarl. 
Almost lost entirely to the Scourge, this system sits on the rim of the Heleus cluster and boasts little of any value to the Initiative. 
Along the galactiv pathway from Onaon to Nol, the Sabeng system is home to no settled worlds, but may hold some interesting prospects for explorers. 
Mineral wealth from this system once supported Angaran settlements in the nearby Nol system, but now holds nothing of particular value. 
This sparsely populated system is home to little other than the icy Angaran stronghold on Voeld. 
Sitting between the inhabited Nol and Govorkam systems, this desolate cluster of space rocks contains nothing of any value to anyone.

PLAY! A Video Game Symphony Takes Over Chicago - IGN

The music of Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Metal Gear Solid, The Legend Of Zelda, HALO, Super Mario Bros., Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, World Of Warcraft, Kingdom Hearts, Shenmue, Silent Hill, Battlefield 1942, and Sonic The Hedgehog is coming to Chicago.
The world tour of "PLAY! A Video Game Symphony," will premiere in Chicago at the Rosemont Theater on Saturday, May 27th, 2006.
The music culled from the aforementioned classic and popular videogames will be performed by a full orchestra and choir, thus bringing the sounds of these games to life in vibrant 3-dimensional soniference.
Arnie Roth, music director and principal conductor of the Chicagoland Pops, will conduct the two-hour musical extravaganza. "It's no secret among game lovers and connoisseurs of orchestral music that some of today's most thrilling scores are coming out of the video game genre. This spectacular concert series speaks to the growing popularity and artistic sophistication of this form of entertainment and will attract people of all generations to some of the world's greatest concert halls," says Roth.
Accompanying the music will be key gameplay sequences from the various games. These images will be projected on large screens suspended above the orchestra.
Making the Chicago event even more special will be the appearance of Nobuo Uematsu, the noted composer of the Final Fantasy series. Uematsu composed the official opening fanfare for "PLAY!" that will kick off every concert worldwide. His music from Blue Dragon also will be performed for the first time at the "PLAY!" premiere in Chicago, which will include never seen before visuals from the highly-anticipated Xbox 360 title.
VIP tickets will be available for the Chicago performance, offering fans the opportunity to meet and greet composers Nobuo Uematsu, Koji Kondo, Yasunori Mitsuda, Jeremy Soule, Yuzo Koshiro, Marty O'Donnell, Akira Yamaoka, Jason Hayes, and many others.
Tickets can be purchased at the Rosemont Theater box office, at Ticketmaster and by phone (312) 559-1212.
Following its North American debut in Chicago, "PLAY! A Video Game Symphony" will travel to Stockhom, Sweden for a sold-out show on June 14, 2006.
Additional concert dates are scheduled for Detroit, Philadelphia, Virginia and Toronto.

Warning: Full spoilers for the Prison Break season finale below.

When Prison Break originally wrapped up in 2009, the death of Michael Scofield gave the otherwise happy ending a touch of poignancy and tragedy. The conclusion of the Prison Break revival goes to a similar place, but this time, Michael gets to live. And the big death seems even more unnecessary than before.
Project Scorpio Info Leak Re-Confirms 6 Teraflop GPU - IGN

A look at official information from Microsoft about the upcoming Project Scorpio has been analyzed and gives more clues as to the power of the iterative update to the Xbox One.
Digital Foundry, who made a video sourcing information from a public-facing Microsoft report, says the whitepaper confirms Scorpio is getting a different RAM architecture than Xbox One, four times the L2 cache, and gives more evidence of a six teraflop GPU.
That means the GPU in Scorpio has around 4.5 times the compute power of the current Xbox One.
Digital Foundry's analysis also casts doubt the CPU will have AMD's new Zen architecture, and will instead use chips based on the Jaguar family, as is the current case with Xbox One, PS4, and PS4 Pro.
The whitepaper gives suggestions to developers for hitting that 4K sweet spot the Scorpio aims for with Xbox One games. Efficiency suggestions recommend similar practices seen with the PS4 Pro, including a technique known as "checkerboarding" or "sparse rendering."
Some parts of an image, such as shadows, can be rendered at half resolution with no real deterioration in quality, allowing for gains in efficiency, according to Digital Foundry.
Basically, the techniques allow games to render at 4K without needing to also scale up in lockstep with compute power.

                                                The Surge is an action-RPG that features innovative combat mechanics and an original character progression system based on modular upgrades gained through tight, visceral combat. Set in a heavily dystopian future as Earth nears the end of its life, those who remain in the overpopulated cities must work to survive as social programs become saturated by an ageing population and increasing environmental diseases. As the intelligence of technology incrementally increased over the years, many jobs for the human race had been made redundant, forcing Earth's citizens to head out into the suburbs seeking labor, aided by exoskeletons to improve their efficiency. The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.

Psyonix 'Evaluating' Whether to Bring Rocket League to Nintendo Switch - IGN

Since its launch in 2015, Psyonix's Rocket League has seen growth in both the platforms it's available on as well as in its continually growing user base. So how likely is it to see the rocket-powered soccer game come to the Nintendo Switch?
Speaking to IGN, Psyonix Studios' Vice President Jeremy Dunham said that the studio behind the game is "evaluating" the possibility and the various factors involved, including true community demand and technical limitations, in bringing the game to a new platform.
QR Codes - Watch Dogs Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There are a total of 16 QR Codes scattered across the 6 regions of Chicago in Watch Dogs. Finding all QR Codes will unlock a bonus mission. Completing the bonus mission will earn you the Read-only Trophy or Achievement, as well as a new weapon, the Gangster Tommy Gun 
 


To reveal the code locations on your map you must unlock all CtOS Towers. The displayed locations aren't very accurate though and you must find one specific surveillance camera and look at the QR Code from a certain angle. The correct camera is sometimes far away, or can only be activated from an elevated position. 
Viewing each QR Code also unlocks an audio log. All Codes are saved automatically when you find them. None of them are missable and you can still get them in free roam after beating the story. They are also a requirement for the They Call Him The Vigilante Trophy or Achievement. 
Located on the southern part of the island in Brandon Docks, climb onto a Racine building to get a view of the camera you need to hack that's attached to a boat storage facility. Look back across the open space to see the QR code. 
Climb up to the platform of the El station here to find the camera you need to hack. Now look at the smoke stacks to find the QR code you need to scan. 
Located at the end of the river in Brandon Docks, look for a grey building right next to the bridge that crosses the river. Now look across the river with the camera to find the QR code. 
Found on the southeast corner of the island in Brandon Docks. Look for a camera on the opposite side of the road from the QR code, and look back across the street with the camera to find the code. 
Found in the southwest corner of the map, look for a camera on the corner of a brick apartment, at the very top. Hack this then look across the roof tops to find the QR code. 
This one will require a boat. Sail off to the very western edge of the map, and hop off at the big metal locks. Find a camera over here, and scan the QR code. 
Located by the baseball stadium, look for a camera on the corner of a brick building with a billboard on top. Focus it on the QR code and scan away. 
Located to the western side of Parker Square, find a camera that's behind a barbed-wire fence. Hack it, then look at the QR code at the end of the block. 
Go to the bridge that is under construction to find a camera right along the incomplete edge. Hack this, then look at the road tunnel to find the QR code. 
Found in an alley in The Loop, look for a camera on the corner of a big building by the QR code, then look up to scan it. 
To get to the camera, this one will require some climbing and careful lining up of Aiden. First follow the train tracks past a bend near the QR code, afterclimbing up the platform, follow the tracks until you see some metal stairs, then climb onto a big AC unit. Look up to find a camera on the building next to you. From here, find the QR code. 
Go to the river by where you access The Bunker, and cross the river under the bridge. Find the camera you need to hack under the highway here, then look back over by the hobo camp. 
Get to the last The Loop El Stop before the train crosses into Brandon Docks. From the platform, look in the opposite direction of the QR code to find the camera on a wall. Look up to scan the QR code. 
From across the highway along the north edge of Mad Mile, use a lower camera to reach a higher camera. From here, look back across the highway at the QR code. 
Found right in the middle of Mad Mile, look for a castle-looking building to find the camera you need. From here, look up at the skyscrapers around you. 
Located on the western side of Mad Mile, find a massive white building. Hack the camera, then look for another big, white building with a camera on an angle. Now look across the street and up for the QR code. 
 


After you have scanned the 16th QR code, Aiden will get a phone call from DedSec. It looks like the shady hacker group wants to get back at Giggles, the hacker who left all of the QR codes lying around. Go into Mad Mile and find the switch box outside of Giggles' apartment. You will have to solve a very complicated hacking puzzle. Once done with that, you are in control of a video feed in Giggles' apartment. Hack into the mainframe and upload the virus from DedSec. Once done, vacate the area.

Ranking the Final Fantasy Games - IGN

Few video game franchises have remained as consistently incredible as Final Fantasy. For nearly 30 years, each new Final Fantasy game from Square (and later Square-Enix) has been a major cultural event. But which games in this beloved franchise are the best, and which were a little too experimental for their own good?

Ranking the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies' Box Office Openings - IGN

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales debuted to an estimated $62.2 million domestically over the Memorial Day weekend, along with the 12th largest international box office opening ever with about $208 million. But how does the fifth Pirates film's debut stack up to Jack Sparrow's previous voyages?
Take a look below to see how all five Pirates of the Caribbean films' box office hauls compare in regard to opening weekends both adjusted and unadjusted for inflation, as well as total worldwide gross. Numbers via Box Office Mojo.
Should the estimates hold for Dead Men Tell No Tales' opening weekend it will still have the second-lowest opening of the entire Pirates franchise, both adjusted and unadjusted for inflation. Dead Men Tell No Tales may actually have the lowest opening if final box office numbers are adjusted below $62 million, which is the adjusted opening weekend tally for the original Pirates of the Caribbean, released back in 2003. (The first film is also the only Pirates movies to be released in less than 4,000 theaters.)
Dead Man's Chest reign as having the biggest opening weekend, unadjusted and adjusted, will continue to hold regardless of the actual box office returns, while it is also likely to stay on top in terms of total worldwide gross, having made $1.07 billion in its theatrical run.
Dead Men Tell No Tales' global cume, so far, is about half of what The Curse of the Black Pearl made in the franchise's maiden voyage. The fifth Pirates film has pulled in approximately $77 million so far, and is set to face continued blockbuster releases as the summer movie season continues to roll out.
Wonder Woman, The Mummy, and Cars 3 open in the next three consecutive weeks, with Transformers: The Last Knight also opening before the end of June to offer continued competition for Pirates throughout the month.

Rime Review - IGN

On the surface, Rime is a gorgeous, melancholy adventure of a lone wanderer in the similar fashion as memorable games like Ico, Journey, or The Witness. But just under that layer of beautiful art, mysterious locations, and wonderful music, is a game with very few new ideas. Instead, almost all of its puzzles are shallow and ultimately uninteresting versions of things we've seen and done in other, better games.

Riot Games Drops 'Warsongs,' an EDM Album Inspired by League of Legends - IGN

Warsongs is currently available to listen to and download for free on Riot's website, as well as YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud.

Samsung TVs to Fix Nintendo Switch HDMI Problem - IGN

Samsung's latest TVs include a feature that has them automatically switch to what they perceive to be a newly-active HDMI input, but docked Switch consoles (among other devices) appear to trigger that feature even when notionally turned off.

Secret Empire #3 Review - IGN

Secret Empire certainly doesn't lack for scope. This is one of those event comics that really does extend into every corner of the Marvel Universe, from superheroes to supernatural figures to cosmic empires. The only down side to that massive scope is that it takes a while simply to arrange all the pieces on the board. That's a problem Secret Empire #3 runs into. With so much emphasis on introducing new characters and conflicts, there's precious little room to build on what the series has already introduced.
The main, overarching conflict of the series is actually pretty straightforward at the moment. As this issue establishes, both Hydra and the Avengers are desperately searching for the scattered fragments of the Cosmic Cube, and both seek to restore the world to the way it once was. The main differences being both sides have drastically different ideas of what "it once was" actually involves. But straightforward though that conflict may be, the sheer number of rival factions and new players cropping up is getting to be a bit much. This issue especially suffers from two late-stage additions that threaten to bog down the series rather than truly enrich the core Hydra/Avengers conflict.
Still, there's plenty to like about this event, particularly when it comes to writer Nick Spencer's ability to hone in on the characters swept up in this vast saga of betrayal and conspiracy. Superior Foes of Spider-Man fans will be especially pleased with the direction this issue takes, as we get a better idea of how the remaining players in Marvel's criminal underworld are faring under Hydra's reign. Secret Empire is shaping up to be a crucible in which many heroes are tested and the general conflict between heroic ideals and pragmatic action becomes paramount. Despite all the colorful trappings, Secret Empire is a story that speaks very eloquently to the current political climate in a way Civil War II never really managed.
Reading issue #3 makes it all the more apparent that Marvel might have taken the wrong approach to series in terms of visuals. There are some scenes where Andrea Sorrentino's haunting art style is a huge boon for the series. His rendition of war-torn Atlantis is awe-inspiring, and his bold page design never fails to create a strong impression. Sorrentino also ensures that Hydra members has never looked more sinister. But there are cases where the book calls for a lighter, subtler touch that Sorrentino can't really deliver. The scenes of Cap and Sharon Carter taking a quiet daytime stroll are one notable example. I wish Secret Empire had been structured more like Infinity, where the rotating artists had been assigned specific story beats best suited to their particular strengths rather than tackling whole issues.
The good news is that Rod Reis continues to bring the right touch to his interlude segments. It's impossible to say what exactly these scenes are depicting or whether they're even meant to be taken at face value, but they lend a welcome touch of unpredictability and even optimism to an otherwise bleak story. Reis' dreamy art style captures the generally ethereal quality of these scenes very well.
Secret Empire is not a perfect event comic by any means. The series is becoming crowded with characters even as the actual plot begins to lose momentum. And while Andrea Sorrentino's art is frequently gorgeous, Sorrentino isn't versatile enough to handle all aspects of the story. But despite its flaws, Secret Empire manages to grab the reader's attention in a way that too few crossover events ever truly manage.

See Every Shadowverse: Rise of Bahamut Card - IGN

One of my favourite games this year was Shadowverse, a CCG that took inspiration from the likes of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, but ultimately came to the table with a number of fresh - and strong - ideas and mechanics. The game has already seen one major expansion - Darkness Evolved, and the second will be in the wild on December 29. It's called Rise of Bahamut and contains 105 new cards, with some cool gameplay twists.
See Every Shadowverse: Tempest of the Gods Card - IGN

The next Shadowverse expansion, Tempest of the Gods, is going to be out very very soon, and after several weeks of card reveals (including eight of our own), we now have the full set.
It's a genuinely exciting collection, offering up some powerful new takes on existing mechanics like Bloodcraft's Vengeance and Shadowcraft's Necromancy. It also takes several classes in new directions - Forestcraft is being given control tools, for instance, while Runecraft players are being tempted to build their decks around Earth Sigils. It's also worth pointing out that this is the first expansion where every class has been given two new Legendaries, and those cards are typically geared towards powerful effects that must be built around.
But hey, don't take my word for it. Check out the new cards yourselves in the slideshows below! (Each card's text is in the caption field, by the way. Apologies to users of IGN's iOS/Android apps - I believe there may be issues seeing the captions on those platforms.)

Settling Worlds - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page explains how to establish new Outposts on and increase the viability of the many worlds that Ryder visits in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Reaching 100% Viability on a planet unlocks the Terraformer Trophy / Achievement, while reaching it on all planets will unlock All Clear. 
Building a new colony for Milky Way settlers in the Heleus Cluster is no easy feat, especially when many of the planets that had originally been designated as "Golden Worlds" are no longer ideal environments to sustain life. 
Due to the surprisingly inhospitable climates found on the various planets that the Andromeda Initiative had hoped to colonize, new outposts must be established elsewhere. 
A planet's Viability Rating determines how suitable it is for settlement by Initiative colonists. Ryder raises this rating incrementally by completing various activities on each world. Complete these to raise the planet's Viability Rating to 100%.

Sex and Romance - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Mass Effect: Andromeda Sex and Romance guide contains a List of Characters You Can Romance and information on the romantic encounters that are found in Mass Effect Andromeda. 
Romance options vary depending on which Ryder twin you choose to play. While Scott and Sara Ryder can get the flirt option with numerous people (like Scott can flirt with Natalie Dormer's character, Dr. Lexi T'Perro) they can be rejected after the first instance if the character isn't romance-able or if they aren't attracted to that Ryder. 
This iteration in the series opens more kinds of relationships for the protagonist. See the chart below for all of Ryder's romantic options. Most romances occur after having several conversations with an individual. You'll see a heart icon appear that'll allow Ryder to flirt. Some characters, like squadmates, won't let you progress in their relationship until you've completed their character-specific missions. 
The way to romance characters is rather standard: flirt when you see the heart icon, and if the character is interested, they'll convey that to your chosen Ryder. Most will update their conversations after you complete a major mission or character specific mission that'll allow you to further your romance. 
Flirting with every character at the beginning doesn't hurt your chances with the others later on. 
Cora was the ranking officer on your father's Pathfinder team before you took over, and an accomplished soldier. Ryder's ascent to the role of Pathfinder may have initially been a point of contention between the two, but the two eventually manage to put aside their differences. 
 


A former mercenary and smuggler, Vetra is now your requisitions officer on board the Tempest. While she presents a hard exterior (both emotionally and with her Turian exoskeleton), she cares greatly for her younger sister and the work the Tempest crew is doing. 
For both the male or female Ryder, flirting with Vetra can begin almost immediately, but it doesn't become anything more than playful until after completing her loyalty mission.

Shido's Cruiser - Persona 5 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The following is IGN's walkthrough for the seventh Palace in Persona 5, Shido's Cruiser. 
You can freely infiltrate this Palace starting 11/25 and your deadline is December 18. 
The following Personas are available in this Palace: Sarasvati (Priestess), Titania (Empress), Dakini (Empress), Oberon (Emperor), King Frost (Emperor), Forneus (Hierophant), Parvati (Lovers), Narcissus (Lovers), Cerberus (Chariot), Kurama Tengu (Hermit), Emperor's Amulet (Hanged), Baphomet (Devil), Hanuman (Star), Garuda (Star) 
 


It's time to infiltrate Shido's Palace to find and steal his treasure! You can clear this Palace in one day, but make sure you enter no later than 12/15 so that you can send the calling card on 12/16 and steal his heart on 12/17. 
Head into the Palace when you're ready. 
Just like before, head up two floors and go through the door on the third floor. There will be Shadows patrolling the floors and halls from now on, so watch out! 
You need to start finding VIPs to get their letters of referral. To get to the first, head down the path to the south and up the stairs to go through the door to the next room. 
In this new room, head down a floor and then through the door to the south-east that leads to the restaurant. 
Head down the path and speak to the waiter. He will tell you that you need a membership card to enter the restaurant. Head back out to the previous area. 
Head up the stairs and over to the north-west corner of the second floor. You'll find a group of men and women chatting and they'll have a speech bubble over their head. Go listen to them and you'll find out that one of the men lost his membership card and that one of the bartenders most likely has it. 
Head back down a floor and go speak to the bartender at the north-east bar. Ask him if anyone has turned in a membership card and he'll hand it over to you. 
Head to the south-east corner of the room and go to the restaurant. 
This time, you can go up to the waiter and show him your membership card. That will let you go into the restaurant. 
After speaking to the waiter, someone will need to take a seat. Regardless of who you pick, Skull will forcibly volunteer and Queen will go with him. 
After some less than pleasant conversation with Mr Ooe, he will become his Shadow-self and you can fight him. 
Politician Ooe seems to be susceptible to critical hits, so physical and ranged attacks might prove efficient against him for you as they did for us. In addition, he is weak to Psychic. More so, he will use a number of buff and debuff abilities, so if you make sure to clear his buffs and your debuffs, you will be able to mostly prevent him from doing any substantial damage to your team. He does, however, use Ice skills, so watch out for those. 
Defeating Ooe will grant you your first letter of introduction. From there, head to the north-west side of the restaurant and go up the lift into the next area. 
 


Make your way up the stairs and into the room with the statue of Shido. You'll all turn into mice! This is one of the main mechanics of this Palace. When in the range of an active Shido statue, you'll turn into a mouse. However, use this to your advantage by going through ducts that are too small for your human form and by sneaking behind Shadows that won't notice you as easily. Additionally, you won't be able to open doors while in your mouse form and you will be very vulnerable to attacks, so keep that in mind. 
In this room, there's a small duct you can go through on the east wall. Head through and unlock the door to the south since you'll now be in your human form. From there, head through the door to the north. 
First head down the path to the west and into the larger room. There will be several Shadows in there, so watch out! There are a few small ducts you can crawl through in this room, but the first you'll want to go through is the one on the east side of the north wall. Head through and unlock the door at the west end of the hall you'll enter. Then, head through the rooms and to the lantern-like statue. Interact with it to disable the Shido statues in the vicinity. 
Once you've turned the lantern off, head back up the path to the east and proceed south through the room you'll enter into. Since the Shido statues can't change you anymore, head through the door down the south path and then south again (your first left) back to the area you previously came from. 
Head down the east path you'll quickly from across and then south in the room you'll enter into since you can now open the door in it. Make sure to unlock the locked door to the west as you make your way south down the path. 
As you head south down the main path on the east side of the map towards the lift marked on your map, you'll have the option to go west (the middle of the three western paths). There is only a single chest down that way, so it's optional. Your destination lies to the south-most west path. Head through the door at the bottom and into the lift at the end of the path. 
Make sure to get the safe room to the south when you first enter the Pool Deck area. Additionally, there should be a Treasure Demon located in the north-east corner of this area by the door on the pool level. 
Head north out onto the pool deck itself and take a look around. The noble you're looking for is located in the south-west of the area. He's lounging on a pool chair and has a speech bubble above his head. Speak with him when you're ready. 
Since he seems to have no interest in speaking with you, you'll need to get his interest. Go to the woman in the south-east part of the pool area and speak with her. She'll tell you about the swimsuits that are on rental. 
Head back to the west side of the area and talk to the waiter at the bar about renting swimsuits. Unfortunately, you can't get any without a boarding pass, which you have no way of getting since you've snuck in. 
To get into the fitting rooms, head around the stairs you came down and into the duct on the wall. Kick it to open it and then crawl through. Examine the fitting room stalls to continue. 
Though you will get a letter of referral due to Ryuji's baring plan, you'll still have to fight. The Former Noble in his Shadow form is weak to Electric skills, so be sure to bring Ryuji to take him down quickly. He will try to brainwash team members, too, so be careful. Having Haru on your team to remove ailments will help a lot. 
 


Once you've defeated the former noble, head to the north-east part of the pool deck and through the door to the next area. 
Take your first left to the north down the hallway until you reach a hall that will turn you back into a mouse. You will now find Shido statues in the halls as well as the rooms and will have to deal with them accordingly. 
Make your way east, though be sure to go through the ducts on the south wall to unlock doors as you proceed. You will also be able to properly fight Shadows while in the southern hall that is parallel to the one that turns you into a mouse. Unlocking the doors allows you to make your way through that section of the area without having to worry about transforming. 
Eventually, you'll have to go south after going east to the end of the path. Head south and up the stairs and then all the way down to the west end of the hall you'll be in so that you can unlock the door. Then, head down the hall you just passed and into the next room. 
There will be a lantern that you can interact with turn off the effects of the Shido statues. Only do so if you want to then head down the hall to the room to the west where there will be a chest to the north. It might also be a good idea to do this to take out the Shadow along the way. 
Either leave the lantern on or turn it back on and then head into the room to the west. You'll turn into a mouse so you can now crawl through the duct in the south-east corner of the room. 
Watch out for the Shadow patrolling the hall you can emerge into. It's best to wait until it's walked by so that you can ambush it with its back turned to you. From there, head up the first hall you'll come across and unlock the door (to the north). Then, return to the lantern and turn it off. 
Head back to the hall that you were just in and proceed to the east into a room and through its eastern door. We recommend you go to to the room at the end of this hall and take out the Shadow as you will need to return to that room soon. After that, take the first north path you came across. It does not matter if you go east or north on this path here as both paths will lead to the same location. 
You'll want to get onto the northern path from your location and head west to unlock the door. Once again, interact with the lantern to turn it on and go to the room at the east end of the parallel hall to the south as indicated previously. You'll be able to crawl through a duct in that room and go into the locked off hall. 
Unlock the door at the west end of the hall and then go to the lantern and turn it off before heading east down the hall into the next part of the area. 
Head east down the hall and then north when you reach the room to get closer to the exit of the area. Before you go north into the larger room with a few Shadows, make sure to unlock the door to the west of it. 
Head through the east door of the large room and you'll quickly reach the exit to the next area. 
Watch out for the powered up Shadows. They now have assault rifles that can shoot you from a distance. 
Head down to the lower level of the deck and get the safe room near the stairs. 
From the safe room, head around the stairs to the north and you'll see a door. Head up to it and you'll be intercepted by someone who works for Shido. He will then summon two Heretic Goats (Baphomets) for you to fight. 
Despite their appearance, they will use Ice and Electric attacks on top of Fire and block Curse but are weak to Bless. However, they aren't very strong on their own so they'll go down quickly. After you beat the, get the chest under the stairs and then head through to the Entertainment Hall. 
 


Head down the spiral staircase and into the main area of the gambling hall. Then, head north and around to the south to make your way down the grand staircase. There's a safe room located very close to the stairs you just came down. 
Head down the stairs in the centre of the floor you're on and you'll quickly come across the television station president. After getting the invitation from him, you'll face off against him and his two minions. 
The flying Shadows (Raging Bird Gods) are weak to Electricity while the TV station president is weak to Ice, so be sure to exploit those with Ryuji and Yusuke on your team. 
 


Head back up the stairs once you've defeated the TV station president and go through the door to the north-west. 
Head into the large room and then directly across from where you enter so that you can go through the south door on the west wall. All other doors are currently locked. 
Head south down the path and through the south door, since the west door is currently locked. Then, go to the checkmark on your map and activate the lantern, though you might want to take out the Shadow first. 
From there, head to the southern-most part of the hall you were just in and you can walk through a small duct to a room that is locked off. In your human form, unlock the door to the east and go turn off the lantern. Then, head back into the room you were just in and go through the north door. 
In this hall, make sure you unlock the east door before proceeding west. Head west again from the room you'll enter into and then head north when the west path is blocked by a locked door. 
Since you can only head onwards east in this next room, do so and unlock the door at the end before taking the north path that branches off from it. 
As you head down the path, make sure you unlock the door in the first hallway you come across in case you want a faster route back to the safe room. Otherwise, keep heading down the path to the door at the end. 
Keep moving along the linear path until you reach a room with a locked door and an inactive lantern. Activate the lantern and then head back into the hall you just came from. There will be a small duct you can go through in your mouse form on the south wall. 
Head down the west path and unlock the door. Then, deactivate the lantern you just activated beyond it. Head back to the previous room and then south down the path. Follow it and go into the second (east) of the two rooms you come across. You'll probably want to take out the Shadow here and then unlock the door to the west. 
Now, head all the way back to the lantern and activate it. Then, head into the west of the two rooms. Since you've unlocked the door, head through and then through the small duct on the north wall. Make sure you unlock the door to the west in this new hall in case you need to head back before continuing east. 
Make our way south into a room that will turn you into a mouse and go through the small duct on the east wall. In this hall, you can unlock the door to the south that leads to the large room. Now that the mouse trap is activated in the large room, head into it and into the small duct at the south of the room near the south door. 
Just in case you want to head back, there's a lantern that you can deactivate before heading through the exit to the south. 
There's a safe room to the west that you might want to get before continuing on. From there, head a bit more to the west and you'll face off against a few more Shadows summoned by the man from before. These are the same Heretic Goats (Baphomets) as before. Use Bless skills if you have them as they are weak to them. 
 


Once you've defeated the Shadows, continue west to the next area. 
This area is much shorter than the others and only requires you to move from room to room, turning the lanterns off and on until you get to the exit, much like a block-based puzzle. This area also has some very powerful Shadows/Personas, so it's worth exploring to get them and for training. 
For this section, we will simply tell you which way to go. If the direction says "door," then you'll be in your human form. If it says, "duct," then you'll be in your mouse form. 
The path is as follows once you're in the south-eastern most room: north door, west duct, west door, north hall, east door, north duct, west hall, elevator. 
You will end up back in the central hall once you exit the mid port hallway. From there, head to the restaurant. 
Speak to the waiter inside to get some intel on the IT company's president. After that, head back to the side deck. 
 


Head over to where all the smoke is coming out of on the east side of the Side Deck from a duct on the wall. However, you don't need to worry about that just yet. Instead, climb up the wall across from it and traverse the side of the ship to the IT company president's room. The west leads back to a previous area. 
Futaba will take the lead and display her aptitude with technology to get an invitation, but you'll still have to fight it out. 
The fight will pit you against the IT President and two Scandalous Queens (Titanias). The IT President will use Bless skills that kill in one hit (Hamaon), so make sure to bring a healer who can revive allies or stock up on reviving items for this fight. The Queens are weak to Psychic and not very strong to begin with, so bring in Haru into this fight, however, the IT President can summon more of them. He is weak to Nuclear (the Queens block it), though, so Makoto should be able to help a lot. 
 


Once you've defeated the Shadows, you need to head to the Engine Room. 
Head down to the floor level and interact with the duct and crawl through to the engine room. You might not be able to save for a while, so make sure you do so in the safe room on the Side Deck before progressing. 
You'll quickly enter a fight against the Cleaner's Shadows. You'll face off against four Heretic Goats, all of which are weak to Bless skills. Take them down to continue. 
Once they're all defeated, follow after the Cleaner. Since you can't get into the door he went through, head around to the west and climb up the red crate so that you can crawl through a duct that leads to the room he's in. Jump out and you'll fight against him. 
He'll use powerful Curse attacks that hit the whole team (Maeigaon), a strong physical attack that targets a single ally with high critical hit rate (Myriad Slashes), a number of skills that lower your stats or raise his, and an instakill Curse skill (Mudoon). He's very tough and has no (known) weaknesses, so this fight might take a bit of time to get through. Rangda (Magician) is a prime choice for this fight as it resists Curse and reflects Phsycial skills. 
Once he's down, prepare for another fight. Heal up and restore your SP before pressing on to face off against the Crow of Justice: Goro Akechi. During your conversation with him, you'll rank up to Rank 9 with the Justice Confidant. 
Akechi won't fight alone at first. He'll have two very strong Shadows at his side, both of which he'll turn Berserk with...a different Persona? 
Both Shadows will use Desperation to start off the fight, meaning their attacks will increase dramatically and their defences will drop substantially. Neither has any weakness but the Guard Dog of Hades will drain Fire and the Spear-Wielding General will drain Electric, Dish out as much damage as you can while keeping your health up. 
 


Once they're down, Akechi will enter the scene and face off against the Phantom Thieves. He'll use Light and Dark attacks with Robin Hood and has no resistances or weaknesses. After bringing him down about half of his health, he'll use Megidolaon, a Heavy Almighty attack that will hit your whole team. 
 


However, the fight isn't over once his health has gone down. The harder fight is only just beginning. Akechi will summon the powers of his Persona Loki, the original Trickster, and make himself go Berserk to fight you. 
In this fight, Akechi will resist Curse (and presumably Bless) skills but will otherwise have no other resistances. He will, however, be able to use two moves in a row. The first will usually be a support move and the second and attack, but not always. 
In the first third of his health, he can create a reflective shield against physical attacks (Tetrakarn), use a Severe Physical attack with a good critical hit rate (Brave Blade), and another strong physical attack the can cause despair (Negative Pile). Bring Haru for creating your own physical barriers and consider also bring Ann so that she can both attack, heal, and remove buffs from or debuff Akechi. 
Once you get him below the first third of his health, he will start creating magic barriers (Makarakarn) and will shift to using magic attacks, such as Eigaon (single-target medium Curse), Maragion (party-wide medium Fire), and Maeiga (party-wide medium Curse). He will also start using Megidolaon (party-wide Severe Almighty) as you bring his health down. 
In the final third of his health, he might not always attack, but when he does, it'll be very powerful. He'll use the move Laevateinn, a Severe Almighty attack (though it looks like Curse) that can even one-shot you if you have full health and high defence. It's incredibly strong. 
 


Upon defeating Akechi in his most powerful state, he'll have to face himself in more ways than one. In his one last act of defiance against Shido, you will create an unbreakable bond with Akechi, the Justice Confidant. 
Head up the stairs and out of the area and you'll automatically go to the central passage. 
Approach the Main Assembly Hall door with all your invitations to gain access. Head in and up the lift. 
Here you'll find the treasure which means you've secured your route. Head back for the day and send the calling card when you're ready. 
 


Sending the calling card this time around is more epic than ever. Take Tokyo by storm and send a message to Masayoshi Shido that he could never miss. More than anything, though, it rallies the support of those most loyal to you. Get ready for a fight! 
You will infiltrate Shido's Palace the same night that you send the calling card due to how public it is. 
Make your way into the Main Assembly Hall and face off against Shadow Shido! 
 


This first section of the boss battle comes in three parts. The beast, the wings, and the pyramid. He'll transition into each successively based on how many thirds of his health he has left, respectively. Shido will use two actions on each of his turns. 
Shido's mount will take the form of a beast for the first third of his health. The following are the analytics of the first part of this fight: 
For this fight, having someone who can dispel rage or having items to remove it will be very helpful. Only use magic skills and don't try using Down Shot (if you have it) as it won't work. If it charges, it's going to do a strong attack the next turn, but this will be negated if you drop it below the first third of its health. 
Shido's mount will transform into a winged beast once you take out a third of its health. The following are the analytics for this creature: 
For this fight, bring out two heavy physical hitters (Skull and Fox for example) and one healer (Queen or Mona). Have the two brutes beat down the enemy while the healer heals the team and provides other forms of support. Shido is smart and will sometimes target your teammates with attacks that represent their weaknesses (such as Ziodyne against Mona), so having Haru use Makarakarn on your party could be a useful tactic if needed. 
Shido's mount will turn into this pyramid to protect him when you get him down to the final third of his health. The following are the analytics for this foe: 
This is arguably the easiest form in the fight as it only has one (known) attack and no resistances. Take it down in any way you wish to progress to the next fight. The pyramid will use its attack after charging up with Unholy Convergence. 
 


Just because you've defeated the manifestation of his distorted vision of the masses doesn't mean he's down yet. Now you need to take on an empowered Shadow Shido head on! Shido still cannot be affected by Down Shot. 
Not only does this form have a ton of health, it also packs one hell of a punch! Thankfully, he only has one action per turn this time. Shido has no weaknesses or resistances in this form but here are the moves that he uses: 
When you get him down to half health, he'll use Deathbound. We recommend that you remove Fear from your allies as quickly as you can to deal as much damage as possible each turn. If you've ranked up with your allies enough, they might automatically remove an ailment from an ally. 
Shido will use Heat Riser when you get his health down to a quarter and will most likely follow up with another Deathbound or Megidola. Bring Ann into this fight to remove his statue buffs if you allowed her to know Dekaja. 
The fight isn't over yet, though! Once you get him down to 1 HP, he'll fully restore himself and power up to his max! Though none of his resistances and weaknesses will change, he will now be able to use two actions each turn and will know a few new ones. 
At half health, he'll use Tyrant's Glare and then Tyrant's Wave. He will also start boosting his accuracy/evasion and lowering your team's, so make sure to items and skills to nullify those changes. He will also add Inferno and Diamond Dust to his move set. 
Once you get him down to a quarter of his health, he'll use Tyrant's Glare again and then focus on boosting his attack and lowering your team's accuracy/evasion once more. He will also start using Mudoon. 
 


Escape from Shido's Palace before you're taken down with it. It's Skull's time to shine to help get you all out of there, as though he's making up for tripping during the escape from your first Palace. 
Head home and rest up. That's another job well done for the Phantom Thieves, and hopefully the last. 
Upon going to bed, both you and Morgana will have your own very different dreams.

Shrines - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Shrines are smaller "mini-dungeons" that can be found throughout the open world of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There are 120 Shrines to locate and complete around the map -- each containing a a Spirit Orb. Collect 4 Spirit Orbs to expand your Heart Containers or Stamina! 
Shrines themselves differ depending on their location. Most shrines contain a small dungeon, which will usually features a central puzzle theme, and may include monsters. A few shrines focus on combat in which Link must fight a single combatant. The combat will range from easy to very difficult. 
Fewer still, are "free" shrines. Those include the shrines in the Lost Woods and the three labyrinths. These shrines contain no puzzles or monsters. The Spirit Orb (and treasure chest) are freely given due to the difficulty of reaching the shrine. 
Four special Shrines at the start of the game contain Runes that will be essential to solving the puzzles within, while other shrines contain Spirit Orbs. Note that some Shrines aren't always visible, and Link will need to undertake Shrine Quests to solve riddles to reveal their location. 
Link can trade in 4 Spirit Orbs at any Goddess Statue (located in the Temple of Time and all major towns) to gain either a new Heart Container or Stamina Vessel. 
All Shrine Locations can be seen on the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Interactive Map:

Skills and Abilities - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Welcome to IGN's list of every skill (also known as powers or abilities) in Mass Effect: Andromeda. Here, you will find out what every skill is and what purpose they serve in the game. 
Skills are split into three classes: combat, biotics, and tech. Each offer different kinds of utility in combat. Each squad member has a skill that's unique to their combat style. To learn about those, head over to the Characters' page for information on their specializations. Ryder can have three skills equipped at a time. 
Mass Effect: Andromeda doesn't require players to select one class. Instead, players can choose to upgrade any of the following skills so long as their Ryder meets basic requirements. Putting points into one of the three groups unlocks different Profiles that boost Ryder's abilities and grants bonuses. 
You can respec Ryder on the Tempest for a small fee if you're unhappy with your chosen skills. 
If you're looking for the best skills in Mass Effect: Andromeda, here are some tips for finding skills that are right for you and recommendations for any playstyle. 
Regardless of your loadout preference, you should take advantage of the combo primers and detonators. Primers are things like Pull and Incinerate. Detonators are skills like Concussive Shot and Overload. Pairing any primer and detonator will do a ton more damage on bare enemies, meaning if they're without shields or armor. Even then, you'll still deal more damage. 
Below is a list of some of our favorite skills to get early: 
A majority of the combat skills are passives that award advanced proficiency with certain weapon types. Other skills allow Ryder to equip unique tools, like the Flak Cannon and Omni Grenade. 
Tap Button: Throws a grenade that causes massive area damage after a 2 second fuse. 
Hold Button: Shortens the grenade's fuse timer before throwing. The grenade will explode if held too long. 
Activation requires one power cell from Omni Grenade's limited power cell supply. 
Fires a target-seeking high-impact round that knocks down unarmored, unshielded, normal-sized enemies and detonates combo primers. 
Deploys a temporary energy barricade that will boost shield regeneration for everyone who takes cover behind it. Upgraded versions provide additional combat bonuses for allies. 
Activation requires one power cell from Barricade's limited power cell supply. 
Temporarily vents weapon heat via armor to improve thermal clip efficiency and boost weapon firing rates. 
Deploys an explosive mine that triggers when an enemy comes within proximity of or crosses a sensor laser. Enemies suffer more damage the closer they are to the mine. 
Activation requires one power cell from Trip Mine's limited power cell supply. The maximum number of active mines equals the current number of maximum power cells. 
Fires krogan-designed shells that burst into shrapnel upon impact. Shrapnel damage is reduced against armored enemies. 
Activation requires one power cell from Flak Cannon's limited power cell supply. 
Improves sidearm training for pistols (including submachine guns). Pistols are designed largely for short to mid-range combat and shooting on the move. 
Advanced training improves facility with assault rifles for dedicated combatants. Assault rifles offer moderate accuracy, range, and stopping power. 
Specialized training for close-quarters combatants. Shotguns deal high damage at short range at the expense of poor accuracy at long distances. 
Improves specialist sniper training for long-range combatants. Sniper rifles deal high damage at a distance at the cost of slow firing rates and capacities. 
Intense physical and survival training designed to improve a combatant's stamina and versatility in battle. Improves Max Health and shields by a set percentage. 
Increases combat power damage with each skill point invested in the Combat Skill Group. 
Ryder can learn Biotics to better deal with enemy armor and barriers. Biotics include abilities like Pull, Throw, and Shockwave. 

Tap Button: Lifts an unshielded, unarmored enemy helplessly in the air and primes the target for combo detonations. 
Hold Button: Drags the target enemy or object along with the user. 
Combine with the Throw power to hurl a held target. 
Hurls a gravity field projectile to throw unshielded and unarmored targets away and detonate combo primers. Combine with Pull to hurl held targets. 
Alters the biotic's mass, launching the user at an opponent. Restores some shield strength at the charge's end. Charge detonates combo primers on targets. 
Requirement - 9 skill points invested in Biotics 
Channels energy into a point-blank, high-damage explosion around the user. 
Blasts enemies with a line of explosions that proceeds through walls and other solid objects. Shockwave detonates combo primers. 
Weaves rapidly shifting mass effect fields to slowly damage nearby enemies. Enemies caught are primed for combo detonations. Other powers activated while Annihilation is in use suffer reduced recharge speed. 
Requirements - 9 skill points invested in Biotics 
Hold Button: Generates a frontal biotic aegis barrier that reflects most projectiles and reduces the damage of other enemy attacks. A well-timed initial activation interrupts melee attacks. 
Tap Button: Deploys a gravity well that lifts and damages unshielded and unarmored enemies. Primes enemies for combo detonations. 
Tap Again: End the effect early. 
Requirements - 9 skill points invested in Biotics 
Devastates a small area with a swiftly thrown shaft of energy. Inflicts bonus damage against enemy weak points (such as heads) and detonates combo primers. 
Maximum Shield strength scales with each skill point invested in the Biotic Skill Group. 
Requirements - 9 skill points invested in Biotics. 
Increases biotic power damage and force with each skill point invested in the Biotic Skill Group. 
Increases the duration of biotic power effects with each skill point invested in the Biotic Skill Group. 
Tech skills are helpful for taking down enemy shields and provide for other unique tactical opportunities. 

Tap Button: Unleashes an electronic discharge upon a target. High damage to shields and synthetic enemies. Detonates combo primers. 
Hold Button: Charges Overload, causing it to "chain" two additional targets. 
Fires a plasma projectile that does bonus damage to armor and inflicts ongoing burning damage to unshielded foes. Burning enemies are primed for combo detonations. 
Deploys an automated assault turret that counts as a tech construct. 
Tap Button: Directs the turret to attack a particular target. 
Hold Button: Detonates the turret, damaging nearby enemies. 
Requirements - 9 skill points invested in Tech 
Hold Button: Directs a continuous stream of super-cooled particles that freezes targets, priming them for combo detonations. Freezing disables unarmored enemies and weakens enemy armor, but has no effect on shielded foes. 
Restores Shields by sapping electromagnetic energy around a target. Causes bonus damage to shields and synthetic enemies, and detonates combo primers on all primed enemies. 
Employs light-bending technology to render the user invisible at the cost of shield and health regeneration. Guns, powers, and melee attacks used from cloak gain a damage bonus but break the cloaking effect. 
Requirements - 9 skill points invested in Tech 
Hold Button: Unleashes a short-range jet of flame that causes bonus damage to armor and ongoing burn damage. Unshielded enemies held in the jet catch fire, priming them for combo detonations. 
Investigate Remnant technology to unlock this skill 
Infects opponents with an invasive VI-controlled machine swarm that weakens defenses and spreads itself to nearby enemies. 
Improves defenses and support for the whole squad through kinetic barrier generator and hardsuit enhancements. 
Requirements - 9 skill points invested in Tech 
Increases tech power damage with each skill point invested in the Tech Skill Group. 
Increases the effect duration with each skill point invested in the Tech Skill Group.

Smite Oceania Pro League 2016 Offers $100K Prize Pool - IGN

Hi-Rez Studios continues to expand support for the pro level of Smite in the Oceanic region for season three of its eSports competition.
How much extra support? Try $100,000AUD in the prize pool this year for professional teams from Australia and New Zealand.
This $100K prize pool tops Hi-Rez's previous highest prize pool offering of $65,000AUD in 2015, of which Smite Oceania Pro League victors Avant Garde took home the lion's share.
"Since introducing the Smite Pro League to the Oceania region last season [season two], we've been very excited to see the growth in quality and competitiveness of the scene," said Hi-Rez Studios' eSports manager Adam Mierzejewski. "We think the Oceania scene will compete very strongly on the world stage in Season 3.
"With over 14 million players worldwide, Smite continues to grow, and Oceania has been an important piece of the game's success. Our goal is to create a sustainable eSports ecosystem for Smite in Oceania that can last for years to come."
The $100,000 prize pool will be split among six Pro League teams and across three events, with the bulk of the winnings set aside for the CGPL Autumn LAN finals on April 16 and 17.
The Oceanic region will be competing across three "Splits", with Split One kicking off on February 27.
Avant Garde and Dire Wolves, runners-up in the 2015 final, receive automatic seeding, and will be competing against the top two teams from two qualifying stages.

Sony Files Patent for What Looks Like a Switch-esque Handheld - IGN

It looks like Sony may be taking cues from Nintendo, as the PlayStation manufacturer has filed a patent for what looks like a new Switch-inspired handheld device.
As spotted by NeoGAF user ponpo, the patent was filed back in 2015 but was only just recently published. While the controller pieces on the side look as though they may be detachable, they aren't explicitly shown as being removable from the device.
 Sony patent image, courtesy of blog.esuteru.com 

Like Nintendo Switch, the device looks very much like a tablet with two controller halves on either side, but instead of Joy-Cons flanking the screen, the half-controllers on either side of the device look like the handles on a DualShock 4.
South Park: The Fractured But Whole Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
At E3 2016, a long showcase was done, featuring South Park: The Fractured But Whole. 
One of the first things shown off was a basic version of the character creator. You can mix and match various super powers to create your own custom character. We are playing as the New Kid again, so what you create is totally up to you. 
 


Along with the customizable super powers, we also learned that combat has changed. Now, instead of being stuck in basic turn-based combat, you can move around the battlefield. Positioning is important as you can get flanking bonuses, extra attacks, bonus damage thanks to knocking enemies into objects and even use some larger boxes and items as cover. Also, returning are the powerful farts, but this time they are so strong that they can alter the order of combat and other currently unmentioned things. 
The story centers around the children playing as Superheros, and they are going through their version of Civil War, with some of the kids splitting off to fight against Cartman's group. As the New Kid, you will need to upgrade your powers and fight against various foes in the hopes of saving South Park. 
 


South Park: The Fractured But Whole will launch on December 6th, 2016. If you pre-order the game, you will receive a free copy of South Park: The Stick of Truth. 
At E3, we learned that a sequel to South Parth: The Stick of Truth was in the works...South Park: The Fractured But Whole. An earlier trailer revealed a few things we can expect from Ubisoft's foray into the South Park universe. 
 


So far, what we know is that the kids have recovered the Stick of Truth and are planning another adventure. This time however they are ditching the fantasy vibe, and going with their super hero personas. Their names and personas are listed below: 
Cartman - The Coon 
This mysterious vigilante wields sharp metal claws and prowls the rooftops of South Park. Like Cartman, he is an egocentric bully. 
Kenny - Mysterion 
Another dark vigilante, Mysterion carries fireworks and a handgun in his TV appearances. He has the power of immortality. No matter how badly injured, he always returns. 
Stan - Toolshed 
Toolshed has the telemechanic power to control tools. He often uses a power drill as a weapon.

Square Enix to 'Remain Tenacious' in eSports Involvement - IGN

Square Enix has made a few attempts to breach the eSports bubble, and in an investor briefing president Yosuke Matsuda discussed their current efforts in the eSports landscape.
The November 6 briefing highlighted that Square's efforts on PC eSports games in Japan had been "struggling to produce adequate earnings."
"We are less-experienced in the new genre of e-sports, which prevented us from gaining player acceptance in some cases," Matsuda said.
Still, Matsuda reinforced the company's plans to enter the eSports realm.

Standards and Practices - IGN Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page contains IGN's Standards and Practices regarding NDAs and Embargoes, Reviews, IGN First and other topics. 
IGN aims to provide you with content that's timely, comprehensive, and reliable. In order to do that prior to the public release of the game, movie, technology, or other entertainment we're covering, we often have to agree to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and embargoes with the creators of the projects and products we cover. It's a very common practice that allows us to have better content prepped in advance of a game or movie's announcement or release. While we push back when the timing of these embargoes doesn't serve our audience and staff, we never alter our opinion or the tone of a given piece of content as leverage. In other words, we wouldn't alter our opinion of a product just to negotiate for an earlier embargo or exclusive. 
As the industries we cover continue to be more important around the world, embargoes have sometimes been placed after a product's release. IGN does not agree to embargoes that lift after the property we're covering is legally available. For example, if a movie comes out on Tuesday in the UK, we should be free to post our review on Tuesday. If a game has a midnight launch in New York, we should be free to publish our review at midnight Eastern Time. 
TLDR: We agree to embargoes, but not when they lift after the things we're covering are legally available. Whether we like something or not is never part of the embargo decision.

Story Mode - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The story mode in Tekken 7 focuses on the untold tales of the Mishima Bloodline. Taking place after the events of Tekken 6, every event and fight that you experience will give more insight into the on-going feud of the Mishima Saga. 
Parts of the story will be told through in-game cutscenes that transition into battles with characters, while other moments will be still images with dialogue. The plot will jump between perspectives, giving you events from specific characters or from a separate narrator. There are a total of 14 chapters in the main story, with two additional epilogue chapters that unlock after completing them. 
For certain fights during story mode, you will need to defeat an opponent under certain conditions or fulfill specific requirements that you aren't explicitly told beforehand. Most of the time, this just requires you to defeat an opponent before they execute a powerful attack or while they are given a Rage Boost. 
You can change the difficultly at any time during story mode without any penalty. Playing the game on easier or harder settings does not change the content of the story, nor does it change the rewards you gain upon completion. 
Upon completing the main story of the Mishima Saga, you unlock access to the Character Episodes. These side stories are single fight tales that give insight to characters that weren't directly involved with the events of the main story. 
These fights are straight forward and will reward you with a special ending cutscene and fight money when you complete them. You can view the ending videos for each Character Story Episode in the Gallery once you obtain them. Character Episodes have no special conditions and can be completed at any difficulty setting.

Supergirl: Season 2 Review - IGN

Note: this is a mostly spoiler-free review of the second season of Supergirl, which is now available on Netflix. I'll discuss basic plot and character details but avoid getting too deep into specifics.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Supergirl went through some pretty fundamental changes in the transition from Season 1 to Season 2. Not only did the series add several key new cast members (and lose another), production shifted from Los Angeles to Vancouver as the series itself hopped from CBS to The CW. That shake-up wound up working in the show's favor. Unfortunately, over time it became clear that Supergirl still has some significant problems to work through before it can stand alongside the best of the Arrowverse.
The move to The CW did seem to work in the show's favor for the most part. Even ignoring the fact that that it made crossovers with the other Arrowverse shows much easier, that shift helped Supergirl feel slightly more cohesive when held alongside its siblings. Stylistically and tonally, Supergirl felt very much like like a good-natured sister series to The Flash. And with The Flash often being unnecessarily mired in its own darkness this year, it often fell to Supergirl to be the bright, cheery, optimistic alternative.
There's also the fact that the crew working on these Arrowverse shows have gotten pretty skilled at making the most of their limited VFX budgets. Supergirl was a very expensive series for CBS, yet the often lackluster special effects didn't always make it apparent how much money was being poured into the show. In Season 2, however, Supergirl looked better despite costing its new network less. That was especially true with the shots of Kara flying or those depicting Martian Manhunter in his true form. There were still cases where the show's reach clearly exceeded its grasp in terms of special effects (particularly in the season finale), but on the whole Supergirl became a better-looking series in its second season.
Bucking the usual trend, the new season picked up exactly where the previous one left off, with Supergirl (Melissa Benoist) and Martian Manhunter (David Harewood) examining the mysterious space pod that crashed outside National City. That paved the way for the introduction of Mon-El (Chris Wood), a Daxamite refugee and new love interest for Kara. Mon-El's arrival signaled a general change in direction for the series, one that saw the DEO set up a new headquarters in National City and the focus shift more towards the growing tension between Earth's human citizens and the growing number of alien immigrants. The main villains of the season (including Brenda Strong's Lillian Luthor and the members of Cadmus) sought to take advantage of that human/alien tension. Given the general state of the world these days, showrunners Andrew Kreisberg and Ali Adler could hardly have picked a more inspired and relevant direction for Season 2.
That general direction worked less because it was so clearly and immediately topical and more because it spoke to the general appeal of the Superman franchise. More than ever, Kara emerged as a shining beacon of hope and optimism in troubled times. The season's political elements were never really more political or controversial than a call for empathy and understanding among all peoples. And with a lead actress as charming as Benoist lighting the way, it's impossible not to be won over by the show's feel-good approach to superhero storytelling. More than ever, Benoist is the rock upon which this series rests.
Mon-El's debut only furthered Kara's growth this year. Wood proved a fun addition to the cast, but his character really shone whenever the series focused on the growing romance between Mon-El and Kara. As the prince of a xenophobic and hedonistic world, Mon-El arrived on his new homeworld with plenty of rough edges. It was a lot of fun watching Kara help smooth over those edges and inspire Mon-El to become a hero even as the two fell in love. The two characters experienced their share of ups and downs over the course oft he season, and while the general trajectory of their romance was often predictable, the execution never failed to impress.
Mon-El wasn't the only high-profile addition to the series in the early Season 2 episodes. The show finally stopped playing coy with Superman and cast an actual actor in the role (Tyler Hoechlin) rather than simply obscuring a stunt double in shadow. That may well be the best change the series made in Season 2. Within seconds, it became clear that Hoechlin was a worthy successor to actors like Christopher Reeve and Dean Cain, bringing a warmth and charisma to the part that's been sorely lacking in certain other live-action Superman performances lately. The only disappointing part about Superman's inclusion this year is that he didn't appear more often. I can understand the desire to keep the series focused on its title character, but the Kara/Clark dynamic is simply too good not to exploit to its fullest.
This season also introduced two members of the Luthor clan in the form of the aforementioned Lillian and her estranged daughter, Lena (Katie McGrath). Lillian left quite a bit to be desired. One of the biggest problems with Season 1 was the show's inability to generate nuanced, three-dimensional villains. Between Strong's overly intense performance and the character's general lack of memorable characteristics, Lillian did nothing to reverse that trend. Lena, at least, fared better than her mother, mostly because the writers had the foresight not to treat her as a villain. Instead, her defining struggle all season was her desire to redeem the Luthor name and prove that she shouldn't be defined by her brother's actions. The fact that Lena and Kara became close friends over the course of the season added an extra appeal to Lena's character arc, as it only served to highlight the question of whether Lena is truly as selfless and noble as she claims. The season failed to deliver a satisfying conclusion to that arc, but I'll get to that in a bit.
Alex (Chyler Leigh) proved to be another dependable member of the Supergirl cast this year, with some of the season's best moments focusing either on the bond between Alex and her sister or the romance between Alex and Maggie Sawyer (Floriana Lima). Alex's struggle to come to terms with her sexuality proved to be one of the more compelling subplots of the season, particularly thanks to the terrifically executed coming out scene in "Changing." As much as the Arrowverse can frustrate with the insistence on forcing every available character into some sort of romantic subplot, the Alex/Maggie material gave this season real sense of emotional weight. In a show crammed full of metahumans and aliens, the ordinary human drama often stood out more than anything else.

Supernatural: Season 12 Review - IGN

This is a mostly spoiler-free review of Supernatural: Season 12, which is now available on Netflix. That is, until the end of the piece, where a spoiler warning will be provided.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
After the huge cosmic scale of Supernatural's Season 11 (that wound up being a strange, zero-sum game by the end), Season 12 brought things back down to earth in a effective, emotional way that involved the miraculous return of Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) and the shady-turned-diabolical dealings of the British Men of Letters.
Through this arc, the season was able to focus in on a handful of more nuanced themes involving family, wasted potential, and lingering resentment over abandonment. Mary's return was both joyful and painful - for both her and the boys. They welcomed her back warmly, but their relationship was still strained because of how old they were when she was killed and what their childhood was like because of her absence. In particular, Dean and Mary's struggles were more notable because of the fact that he was old enough to remember her being his mom and old enough to take the brunt of John's special form of rearing.

Tekken 7 Review - IGN

Tekken 7 is a love letter to this long-running franchise and its staggering complexity. Yet somehow it still manages to be accessible to just about anyone wanting to mash buttons, and its huge amount of customization unlocks constantly give you something to strive for beyond its silly and slightly cliched story. In a pretty good time for fighting games, with Injustice 2 knocking it out of the park, Killer Instinct continuing to give us quality content years after its release, Street Fighter 5 hitting its stride after a rocky start, and a new version of Guilty Gear Xrd air-dashing our way, the King of the Iron Fist Tournament will not be outdone.

TGS 2016: Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Delayed to January - IGN

While originally slated to release this December, Kingdom Hearts HD II.8 -- Final Chapter Prologue will now release next year on January 12 in Japan and January 28 in the west.
Square Enix revealed the 2017 release date in a new trailer that made its debut at Tokyo Game Show.
TGS 2016: Musou Stars Announced for PS4 and PS Vita - IGN

A new title that mixes much of Koei Tecmo's IP was unveiled today on stage at Tokyo Game Show.
Musou Stars looks to be the Japanese publisher's answer to Smash Bros, cramming characters from popular series like Ninja Gaiden and Atelier under one banner.
Not much was revealed apart from a brief introductory trailer, and the fact that it will launch some time in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and PS Vita.
It's not clear how (or if) it will differ from Warriors Orochi, Koei Tecmo's previous franchise mash-up series.
During the conference, Square Enix also whipped the cloak off a new Final Fantasy 15 Lunar Edition PS4 which will launch on the game's release date, November 29.

The 100: Octavia Gets Ready to Battle to the Death Alongside Some Familiar Faces - IGN

The situation on The 100 has grown more dire than ever, as a meltdown of all of the Earth's remaining nuclear power plants threaten to kill everyone still alive. Last week, we saw that desperate times called for desperate measures yet again, as it was decided that a new Conclave would be held, in which a Champion from each clan would battle to the death, until only one remained - with the winner's people being the ones who get to survive in the bunker that's recently been discovered, which can save a limited number.
IGN has an exclusive clip for you from the next episode, "Die All, Die Merrily," as Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) prepares to fight for Skaikru, joining Roan (Zach McGowan) from Azgeda and a couple other participants she didn't expect to see... including one who no one expected to join this fight.
The official description for the episode ominously reads:
Octavia fights in the final battle for her people's survival, but not everyone is willing to play fair.
I've seen this episode and can say it is one of the show's most intense and harrowing ever. Look for my full review on IGN immediately after it airs on the east coast.
Check out photos from "Die All, Die Merrily" in the gallery below.
The 100: "Die All, Die Merrily" airs Wednesday, May 3rd on the CW.

The 13 Biggest Video Games That Never Came Out - IGN

Update: With the news that Microsoft has officially cancelled Scalebound, let's take a look back at other game cancellations from history that stung the most.
All forms of entertainment have their unfinished projects, but I've found there's always something especially painful about learning that a long-awaited game will never come out. We never properly knew it, so it's not exactly like the loss of a loved one; it's more like spending years wanting to visit a well-loved landmark, only to find it's been wiped off the map or irreparably damaged. The interactivity of games means these are real memories we're losing out on.
Thousands of games have suffered such a fate. We don't even know the names of many of them, but some have had their names shouted to crowds at shows like E3 and generated discussions even some properly released games should envy. These are the games we're talking about here, and fittingly for the bad luck so many of them seem to have suffered, there are thirteen of them.

Fable Legends is the youngest casualty on this list, having been officially cancelled only last month at the time of writing. Its gameplay borrowed heavily from a multiplayer concept made popular in games like Evolve, wherein one player acts as the villain while four others try to take him or her down. Legends' main appeal is that it oozed with the Fable series' signature personality, right down to individualized fart emotes for each hero and its wondrously vibrant hub city of Brightlodge. But hints of its eventual doom were apparent even shortly after its 2012 announcement, whether it was its frequent delays, the constant media blackouts and secrecy, or the shift to a free-to-play model early last year. The actual cancellation thus came only as a slight surprise, but the true gut punch was the total loss of Lionhead Studios, which never really shed the goodwill it had earned from 2008's Fable II. Lionhead never gave us another game like that, but much in the style of Peter Molyneux, Lionhead's famously enthusiastic founder, it was always fun to dream of what could be.

A concept image from Steven Spielberg's cancelled action-adventure game, LMNO.
Steven Spielberg was once in the video games business as a result of a consultation partnership with EA, although his only released game from that effort was 2008's puzzler Boom Blox. But in Arkane Studios' LMNO, we would have had a chance to see what the storied film director could do with a narrative-driven game. The minimal existing footage is pretty stuff, showing a warmly lit '50s diner and your companion, an alien-looking woman named Eve. As is only fitting for a project Spielberg was involved in, LMNO was meant to pull emotional strings, but it was also expected to deliver an unforgettable first-person adventure combining parkour-based escape sequences with roleplaying elements. But it didn't last long. In 2010, EA confirmed that LMNO had been cancelled. In a sprawling longform feature, 1UP detailed the reasons for the cancellation, which basically came down to over-ambition, whether it was in its drive for new types of combat, new types of character interaction, or new replayability options. Ultimately, EA executives didn't like the short demo the team made, and the majority of the staff was laid off in 2008. By 2009 the project landed in the lap of developer Louis Castle, who tried to turn it into a more traditional game called The Escape Artist, but in its push for online multiplayer games at the time, EA soon dropped that, too.

The 9 Best Wonder Woman Comics - IGN

The DC Extended Universe is growing bigger thanks to the release of the new Wonder Woman movie. And hopefully this heroine will find herself a legion of new fans in the process.
No doubt some of these fans will be turning to DC's comics to learn more about the character and fill the wait until she returns in Justice League this fall. Luckily, there are plenty of great stories to choose from. We've selected nine essential stories that helped shape the Wonder Woman franchise and could have an influence on future movies.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
As influential as the stories of the Golden and Silver Ages were, the simple truth is that those comics don't always hold up several decades later. But there's something special about those early Wonder Woman comics penned by co-creator Dr. William Moulton Marston. As a psychologist and a man with some, let's say, interesting ideas about bondage and sexuality, Marston brought a unique flavor to his Wonder Woman work that DC has often struggled to replicate ever since.
In some ways, those early Wonder Woman comics are hokey, outdated and a wee bit sexist. But they're a lot of fun to read. Unlike so many creators working in the nascent early days of the superhero genre, Marston didn't simply recycle the same tropes, but worked to create a new kind of hero who could speak to a more liberated and progressive culture. Both he and his creation were very much ahead of their time.
For now, this hardcover collection remains the easiest way to get a hold of those early Wonder Woman comics. But for those who crave something a little cheaper or smaller, DC will begin reprinting a series of Wonder Woman: The Golden Age paperbacks in November.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Short of Marston himself, no creator has had as profound an influence on Wonder Woman as George Perez. Much as John Byrne took the reins of the Superman franchise after 1985's Crisis on Infinite Earths, Perez was tasked with reinventing Wonder Woman for a new era. But where Byrne sought to streamline and simplify Superman's world, Perez (along with co-writers Len Wein and Greg Potter) made the choice to double down on the larger-than-life elements of Wonder Woman and emphasize her ties to Greek mythology.
"Gods and Mortals" collects the first seven issues of Perez's 1980's run. Together, these issues are regarded as the definitive account of Diana Prince's origin story, exploring her creation on Paradise Island, her first journey into man's world and her first clash with Ares, the god of war. There have been many new takes on that story since, but it's hard to touch this one (especially with an artist as talented as Perez at the helm).
Fans have several options for reading the "Gods and Mortals" storyline at this point. The recent Wonder Woman by George Perez Vol. 1 paperback collects issues #1-14 of the series. DC also recently published a hardcover that includes these seven issues and a copy of the 2009 animated Wonder Woman movie. That's a pretty great package.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Paul Dini isn't just one of the minds behind the seminal Batman: The Animated Series, he's also had quite an impressive career as a comic writer. Wonder Woman: The Spirit of Truth is one of a series of one-shot specials Dini created with painter Alex Ross, each focused on a different Justice League member.
At a scant 64-pages, Spirit of Truth isn't a long read, but it's certainly a memorable one. This character-driven story focuses not on Diana's battles with supervillains, but more real-world threats that aren't so easily punched away. The story is basically a meditation on her humanity and place in the world, one greatly elevated by Ross' gorgeous artwork. The oversized prestige format really allows that art to shine.
Unfortunately, Spirit of Truth and the other Dini/Ross specials are long out-of-print. The good news is that DC will be reprinting them together in a new Absolute Edition hardcover later this year.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Phil Jimenez is easily one of the greatest artists ever to draw Wonder Woman. The fact that Jimenez's style shares so much in common with that of George Perez is surely no coincidence. And those looking for a taste of Jimenez's influential Wonder Woman run would do well to check out this trade paperback collection.
"Paradise Lost" collects several storylines into one volume. The book opens with a fun Batman crossover, as the gods Phobos, Deimos and Eris wind up possessing the bodies of Scarecrow, Joker and Poison Ivy and wreaking havoc in Gotham City. The next storyline focuses on a massive civil war on Paradise Island, with Diana forced to mediate in her mother's absence.
Both of those tales are worth reading, but the real highlight of this book is Wonder Woman #170, a story titled "She's a Wonder!" This standalone issue features an interview between Diana and Lois Lane as the two spend a day together and Lois learns a little about what it means to truly be Wonder Woman. This issue is widely regarded as one of the one of the best in Wonder Woman's long history, and it's well worth tracking it down even if you forego the rest of the book.

The Best 1080p 144Hz Gaming Monitor for 2017  - IGN

Monitors with 144Hz refresh rates aren't new, but they're more popular than ever because, quite frankly, they are pretty awesome. Plus we're just now getting midrange GPUs capable of 100+ FPS on high settings. Back in the ancient days of 2015 that just wasn't possible unless you dropped some major coin, so as performance has increased monitor manufacturers have responded with corresponding features such as ultra-high refresh rates. So if you're in the market for a new display, be sure to check out our list of the best 1080p 144Hz Gaming Monitors.
Instead of updating a screen a measly 60 times a second like most monitors (60Hz), a 144Hz monitor refreshes the screen 144 times every second, which makes action appear smoother and helps eliminate motion blur. If you have enough ponies under the hood, or the stomach to, sniff, lower your game's settings if you're not on a newer GPU, a 144Hz monitor will permanently change your perception of what smooth gameplay looks and feels like, and you'll never be able to go back to 60Hz.
We recently tested five monitors to find the best 1080p 144Hz gaming monitor, and based on our testing there is a clear winner:

The Best All-Around Graphics Cards - IGN

Last updated: March 21, 2017.
When we're old and sitting in our rocking chairs on the porch we'll look back fondly on the year 2016, wipe a tear from our eye, and regale our grandkids about the move to 14nm and 16nm FinFET GPUs. "Your granddad had 100fps at 1440p," we'll tell our grandkids as they ignore us while ensconced in their 32k VR simulations. They won't understand, of course, how amazing the year 2016 was in terms of GPU advancements, but it can't be understated. Not only did we finally move from 28nm planar transistors all the way down to 14/16nm 3D FinFET, but the accompanying performance boost from one generation to the next was one of the largest ever recorded in modern times. Instead of the typical 10 to 20 percent boosts we experience going from one generation of silicon to the next, we saw a 60 to 80 percent boost. Frame rates skyrocketed, 4k gaming became viable with a single GPU, and laptops were able to sport desktop-class graphics for the first time due to improvements in efficiency as well. It was (and still is) a great time to be alive, indeed.
Despite 2016's general awesomeness, 2017 will be even better because we'll finally see AMD challenge Nvidia's supremacy at the high end of the market with its upcoming Vega GPU. In 2016 AMD only attacked the mid-range with the RX 480, 470, and 460 while Nvidia launched (at first) into the high-end with its GTX 1080 and 1070 GPUs, and for a finishing move it dropped the almighty GTX 1080 Ti. This imbalance will be rectified soon with Vega, which should launch by June and will compete directly with Nvidia's flagship consumer GPUs.
Until Vega launches, things will be a bit static in the GPU department, so we wanted to share our picks for the best GPUs currently available.
The Best Fidget Spinners and Fidget Cubes - IGN

If you can't seem to keep yourself still and need something, anything, to occupy your hands, the sudden explosion of fidget toys is just what you need. While they make somewhat dubious claims about their therapeutic benefits, there's no denying the satisfaction of spinning a tiny toy, or clicking and fussing with switches and buttons, while you're otherwise idle. It just feels right. Below we've compiled a list of the best fidget spinners and best fidget cubes you can buy right now. And if you aren't interested in dropping $20 or more on a simple fidget toy, we've also included a few ultra-cheap fidget spinners and cheap fidget cubes that will still get the job done (and likely make a little but more noise while doing it).
Here are some great fidget toys to help keep your mind on track. Bonus! We've added even more, with solid reviews.

The Best Gaming Chairs - IGN

The Best Gaming Keyboard for 2017 - IGN

The Best Gaming Mouse for 2017 - IGN

There are few relationships in the PC gaming world that are as important as the one between a gamer and his or her mouse. That's why it's so important to pick the absolute best gaming mouse. It's the most direct connection you have to whatever game you're playing (no offense to the keyboards reading this). On top of the amount of time spent holding it, the mouse also plays a huge role in games too, since a comfortable, accurate mouse will help you dominate while an unwieldy one will just lead to disaster. Not to overstate it, but from a gaming perspective choosing the right mouse is literally a matter of life or death.
Of course, any experienced gamer already knows how important being up to speed on the best gaming mice is to his or her success. But the problem is it can be difficult to evaluate the myriad options available and figure out which is the most comfortable or most accurate. Nevertheless, we've sampled some of the finest gaming mice available, and would like to offer you our picks for what we think are the best mice for Mac and PC. Note there are several sub-categories of mice - best mouse for MOBAs, wired and wireless mice options, and plenty more which we haven't covered yet, but we will in a future update. For now we're just looking at the best all-around mice for gaming, first person shooters, and daily drivers.
 poilib start 
 poilib end  
The Corsair M65 Pro RGB (See it on Amazon) is a specialized weapon designed specifically for right-handed, claw-grip gamers who play first person shooters. Out of all the mice we tested recently it was the most accurate and the most comfortable, which is really all that matters. We dig its aluminum body, which gives it a distinctly rigid feeling in your hand, and it also includes a custom weight system as well so you can tailor its heft to your liking. What really puts the M65 Pro RGB over the top though isn't its RGB lighting, which we don't really care about, but rather its Sniper button located in the thumb area. When depressed it lowers the mouse's DPI for more accurate tracking, letting us fire off a precise headshot then go back to run-and-gun in games like Battlefield 1. It's even available in white.

Not everyone grips their mouse with their fingertips. Some people like to lay their palm over the length of the mouse and let their fingers dance upon the buttons. For these folks we think the Razer Deathadder Chroma (See it on Amazon) is hands-down the best mouse because it's as comfortable as a velvet bathrobe and as accurate as a weather forecast in Siberia. Unlike a lot of high falutin mice with weights and customizable grips and more buttons than the Space Shuttle, the DeathAdder keeps it simple with just the basics; including buttons for left-and-right click, forward/back, and a mouse wheel. On paper, it doesn't sound like much really, but once we slid our palm over the contoured top and rested our fingers on its scooped buttons, we knew we had found the mouse of our dreams. Even better; the DeathAdder we reviewed was recently updated and is now called the DeathAdder Elite, adding DPI switching and a more precise sensor.

The Best Gaming Router in 2017 - IGN

We know what you're thinking, "Best router for gaming? Any serious gamer is on a hard-wired connection!" We hear you, but everyone still needs WiFi in their home thanks to the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices. And with the arrival of 80211.ac you can actually game over a modem router connection if you're dealing with cable routing issues or another barrier that prevents you from using a wired connection. Plus, the newest wireless protocol (ac) is much faster than its predecessor, 80211.n, and also offers new performance-boosting features as well such as beamforming and MU-MIMO. This is good news for people who might have wanted to try some wireless gaming in the past but gave up due to insufficient bandwidth.
To help figure out which is the best wireless router for gaming, we rounded up five of the top models currently available and put them through their paces, testing at both close and long range through walls. We also took a look at their gaming features (if they had any, as not all of them do), and arrived at a conclusion based on both objective and subjective testing. Based on our test results, there were several excellent options but one clear winner:

Netgear Nighthawk X4S (R7800)
Read our review
See it on Amazon See it on Amazon UK
The Nighthawk X4s was the fastest dual-band router we tested at 5GHz, and also sports gaming-specific Quality of Service that can prioritize gaming packets "intelligently," making it our top choice. As icing on the cake Netgear also offers a decent mobile app, and it supports MU-MIMO for faster wireless transfers to multiple clients. Its UI looks a bit outdated and its legacy 80211.n performance was sluggish, but we think its 5G performance is more important anyway, so we're willing to cut it some slack. Overall we think it offers the best blend of speed and features at a reasonable price.

New gameplay showed off all of Sombra's abilities, which -- appropriately -- lean into her hacker skillset. Luckily, she lived up to our high expectations after all that hype. Check out our impressions from 15 minutes with Sombra:

The Evolution of Game of Thrones Characters - IGN

With the countdown to Game of Thrones' seventh season underway (check out the first full trailer here), we should probably all take a look back at the savage and arduous journeys that the show's main characters have been through since the show premiered back in 2011.
We've watched the mighty fall, the weak get powerful, and children literally grow up before our eyes. Sellswords have become knights, pimps have risen to Lordships, and honored daughters have become rogue assassins. The Game of Thrones gallery is rife with change and many of these characters have endured torture and harsh horrors that worked to shape and mold them through the series.
Below you'll find a slideshow of the series' remaining (still living) main characters, spotlighting their looks through the years and giving you a glimpse at how much they've changed while trying to play the Game of Thrones. Just click right through the images to see the differences, and obviously spoilers for all the past seasons follow!
Game of Thrones' Season 7 premieres July 16th on HBO.

Here's a list of games available for download for Platinum members only, and the systems they are available for:
Galaxy 2 and Punch-Out!! are actually the Wii titles that were recently introduced by Nintendo as downloadable titles for the Wii U. The following games are available to both Gold and Platinum members:
If you haven't yet cashed in your coins for prizes, you still have until June 30 to spend them. But new codes are no longer being accepted, so if you missed your chance to achieve Platinum dreams, you're sadly out of luck.

The Flash: How the Season 3 Finale Draws From the Comics - IGN

Warning: this article contains spoilers for The Flash's Season 3 finale! Read our review of "Finish Line."
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
The Flash's Season 3 finale ended with what could wind up being the show's most status quo-altering twist yet, as Barry Allen retreated into the Speed Force to pay his penance for creating the Flashpoint timeline and Savitar. The rest of Team Flash will have to carry on in his absence in Season 4. Depending how far the writers are willing to take this new development, we could be looking at a fourth season driven not by Grant Gustin's Barry Allen, but by Keiynan Lonsdale's Wally West.
This twist definitely has a precedent in the comics, however. And based on that source material, we have a few ideas of what to expect from the series when it picks back up in Season 4.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Since the series first revealed Eobard Thawne's hidden room in STAR Labs, viewers have been treated to glimpses of a holographic newspaper from the year 2024 with the ominous headlines "FLASH MISSING" and "VANISHES IN CRISIS" plastered on the front, along with another article titled "RED SKIES VANISH." Those headlines basically sum up what happened at the end of this episode. It seems that the "crisis" in question came about seven years sooner than expected. Which makes sense given that Barry and his friends managed to defeat Savitar years earlier than they were meant to.
Comic book readers have always taken those headlines to be references to the epic 1985 crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths. In that crossover, an all-powerful villain called the Anti-Monitor began devouring the entire multiverse, causing red skies to appear on countless worlds. By the time the heroes of a few surviving worlds halted the Anti-Monitor's path of destruction, the multiverse had collapsed into one, unified DC Universe. And Barry Allen was among a number of iconic heroes who died saving the day.
This particular Crisis has nothing to do with the multiverse as far as we can tell, but it did have the same end result as far as The Flash is concerned. In both cases, Barry Allen sacrificed himself for the sake of his allies and was consumed by the Speed Force. And now Wally West faces the difficult task of filling Barry's shoes and becoming the one and only Flash of his world. Though there's no guarantee the series won't eventually tackle a conflict more directly inspired by Crisis on Infinite Earths. That would be good fodder for another four-way Arrowverse crossover...

The Flash: Is the Thinker, aka "DeVoe," Season 4's Main Villain? - IGN

While most of the chatter surrounding The Flash's Season 3 finale surrounds the shocking, status quo-altering ending, that wasn't the only big development to be found in that episode. Savitar may have given fans a major clue as to which DC villain will be headlining the upcoming fourth season. And as promised, this villain won't be another evil speedster, but rather a shadowy criminal mastermind known as The Thinker.
Full spoilers for The Flash continue below.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
"Finish Line" is actually the second episode this season where one of Barry Allen's time-traveling enemies has referenced a character named DeVoe. Earlier, Abra Kadabra spoke of DeVoe in the same breath as Reverse-Flash and Zoom, implying that this villain is in their league in terms of power and overall threat level. And in "Finish Line," Savitar reminisced about building a machine to stop DeVoe's telekinetic powers before reminding himself that Team Flash circa-2017 has yet to encounter this enemy. It would seem the writers are laying the seeds for their next major villain much in the same way Arrow set the stage for Damien Darhk in late Season 3. Here's where we think the show might be headed with DeVoe as its main antagonist in Season 4.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
The "DeVoe" in question is Clifford DeVoe, the first of several DC villains to call themselves "The Thinker." This disgraced ex-lawyer built a new career for himself as a sort of adviser to other criminals, reasoning that they had the drive but not the intelligence to dominate the city's criminal underworld. That naturally put him in constant conflict with original Flash Jay Garrick.
DeVoe became a real threat to Flash once he built himself a "Thinking Cap," a device that granted him the ability to control minds and levitate objects. So while DeVoe is shaping up to be the first non-speedster villain to headline a season, he certainly has enough power to take on heroes like Wally West and Jay Garrick.

The Flash: Season 3 Review - IGN

Note: this is a mostly spoiler-free review of Season 3 of The Flash, which is now on Netflix. I'll discuss basic plot and character details but avoid getting too much into specifics.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Season 3 appears to be the real test for The CW's Arrowverse shows. Arrow followed up its first two seasons with a much rockier third season, leaving that series in a hole of which it's only just now managed to climb out. The Flash went through a similar series of hurdles this year. The Flash: Season 3 was noticeably more uneven than its predecessors, suggesting that maybe Barry Allen's best days are behind him. Luckily, the show was able to recapture its footing where Arrow continued to struggle. The strong last couple months of the season went a long way towards making up for the mistakes that came before.
It was clear right away that Season 3 faced a long, uphill battle. Season 2 ended with an exciting cliffhanger, as Barry (Grant Gustin) traveled back in time, undid his parents' deaths and created the alternate timeline known as Flashpoint. Anyone who's read the Flashpoint comic or watched the animated movie Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox was surely salivating at the thought of seeing a twisted, dystopian vision of the Arrowverse. What the premiere episode, "Flashpoint," actually delivered was slightly less exciting. Aside from a few key differences, this world wasn't a particularly dramatic change from the norm. There was still a definite appeal in seeing Barry briefly granted the happy, quiet life he's always dreamed of, but "Flashpoint" set an underwhelming precedent that would continue on for several months.
Looking back at my reviews of the first half of Season 3, it wasn't until the midseason finale that any episode scored above the low 8 range. That pretty much encapsulates the problems with the season right there. The show was often perfectly fine on a week-to-week basis, but it was rare for any episode to really stand out from the pack. The general status quo in the first half of the season too often struggled to measure up to the Reverse-Flash and Zoom conflicts from seasons past. The end result of Barry's three months spent living in Flashpoint was a handful of changes to the Team Flash dynamic, many of which became all but irrelevant after a week or two. Flashpoint also resulted in the rise of two new villains - Doctor Alchemy and Savitar (both voiced by Tobin Bell). Alchemy never amounted to much more than a shadowy, mysterious string-puller, while it wasn't until the final few episodes of the season that Savitar truly came into his own.
Again, the show really struggled to build a cohesive and compelling direction in the early months of Season 3. It was a long, long time before it became clear exactly what separated Savitar from previous speedster villains. Nor did Alchemy's quest to restore the Flashpoint status quo do much to build a strong narrative hook. More than ever, the series was forced to fall back on the core Team Flash dynamic. At least it always has that element to rely upon. The Flash may no longer be the best the Arrowverse has to offer, but after three years I've become very invested in the collective struggle of this unusual family of speedsters and geniuses.
There was plenty of character drama to work through early on, much of it the direct result of Barry's time-meddling. Iris (Candice Patton) and Joe (Jesse L. Martin) dealt with a mutual estrangement. Cisco (Carlos Valdes) mourned the death of someone close to him. Both Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) and Wally (Keiynan Lonsdale) dealt with the spontaneous appearance of metahuman powers (with the former dreading her transformations into Killer Frost and the latter relishing his opportunity to follow in Barry's footsteps). That's to say nothing of the complications created by Barry's new co-worker/frenemy, Julian Desmond (Tom Felton). When all else failed, the Team Flash family drama could usually be relied upon to keep the show humming along.
Julian proved an entertaining and somewhat unpredictable addition to the recurring cast, adding a unique voice and temperament to the Team Flash dynamic. But the best addition this year was H.R. (Tom Cavanagh), the latest alternate universe incarnation of Harrison Wells. It's part of The Flash's charm that there must always be a Wells in the picture, even if Cisco and friends have to go on a recruitment drive to find one. Cavanagh again proved to be one of the show's MVP's, playing H.R. as a wholly distinct character compared to Season 1's Dr. Wells and Season 2's Harry. There were even a few opportunities to see Cavanagh play multiple Wellses in the same scene, just for kicks.
This season also got a lot of mileage out of John Wesley Shipp's new role as the real Jay Garrick. Like Cavanagh, Shipp successfully managed to set his new character apart from the old, casting Jay as a grizzled veteran not entirely comfortable with his status as mentor to Barry and his fellow speedsters. The only complaint here is that the season never used Jay as often as it could. That was especially true with the midseason finale, "The Present," which offered a tantalizingly brief glimpse of Jay's rivalry with Earth-3's Trickster (Mark Hamill).
Looking back, the one character who felt oddly underutilized this year was Wally. On paper, it was a big year for Wally, as he gained his speed powers and took his place alongside Barry. That paved the way for several memorable speedster team-ups (including one with Violett Beane's Jesse Quick thrown in for good measure). But there was a specific point in the season where it seemed like the writers completely lost interest in Wally. He all but completely faded to the background and never recovered as a result. The show needs to do better by the character in Season 4.
The character drama gave the early episodes weight where villains like Alchemy faltered, but that drama brought about its own set of problems. Not only was the scope of Flashpoint itself disappointingly limited, the fallout often felt small and perfunctory. Some subplots, particularly the Joe/Iris rift, were quickly resolved and forgotten, almost like they never happened at all. And at some point, the series simply felt too mired in darkness. Character drama is great, but this series has always thrived on its ability to balance that drama with lighthearted adventure and that ever-important sense of hope. But Barry Allen became more morose than ever this year, and his misery seemed to envelop everyone around him. It didn't help that The Flash was airing new episodes at the same time as fellow Arrow-verse/CW series Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow, two shows that did a much better job of balancing character drama with lighthearted fun this year.
By the time the midseason finale rolled around, it was clear that Season 3 had two fundamental problems - an overabundance of darkness and a lack of a clear, compelling supervillain threat. To its credit, the show started making a concerted effort to address both problems around that point, though it would be some time before either was truly rectified.
"The Present" at least established clear stakes for Team Flash and a new conflict to propel the show forward in the second half of Season 3. A good start, though the problem remained that viewers knew very little about Savitar or what motivated this self-styled god of speed in his feud with Team Flash. The writers waited a shockingly long time to actually shed light on the man beneath the armor. In fact, it wasn't until late April that Savitar's identity was finally revealed. That ambiguity weighed on the show for months. As the third speedster villain in as many seasons, Savitar just didn't have the novelty factor or the depth needed to stand out.
Fortunately, that did change once the reveal came and Savitar's true endgame became apparent. The final five episodes went a long way towards reviving the Savitar conflict and building the character into someone worthy of Reverse-Flash and Zoom. That doesn't necessarily excuse the writers for keeping their cards close to the vest for so long, nor their decision to focus on a third speedster villain when there are so many other worthy Flash villains who haven't gotten their due yet.. But at the same time, the reveal did make it apparent why that prolonged secrecy was necessary. Moreover, the reveal wound up tying the season together, forcing Barry to confront his mistakes and his habit of being the architect of much of his own misery. For a villain who remained so aloof for much of the season, Savitar wound up becoming a surprisingly personal villain in the end.
It also didn't hurt that the later episodes placed so much emphasis on Caitlin's fall from grace. I still maintain that Killer Frost should have been the central villain of Season 3. But even as a supporting player in the Savitar conflict, Caitlin added a great deal of dramatic weight to the series, with the writers banking heavily on the strong bond linking Barry, Cisco and Caitlin and the tragedy that arose when those bonds were shattered. This was also a valuable chance for Panabaker to play Killer Frost not as an overt villain, but someone torn between her twisted metahuman side and the good, loyal friend that still remained within.
As for the dark tone, it's no coincidence that some of the best episodes this season were those that diverged from the Savitar conflict and focused on the lighter side of Barry's world. The two-part Gorilla Grodd storyline was very entertaining, offering fans their first real glimpse of Earth-2's Gorilla City and suggesting that Grodd would make for an excellent recurring villain if not for the sheer expense involved in bringing the character to life. The series even took the opportunity to throw in a little levity right before the end, as "Infantino Street" offered a wonderfully entertaining Flash/Captain Cold team-up before moving into the dramatic fallout of Savitar's final attack.
But nowhere did the series shine brighter this season than in the long-awaited musical episode/Supergirl crossover "Duet." For one glorious hour, all the darkness fell away and Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoist were given free reign to sing, dance and just have fun playing superheroes. It certainly didn't hurt that so many actors involved, including Victor Garber, John Barrowman and Jesse L. Martin have serious musical theater chops of their own. Not only did that episode strongly suggest that the musical crossover needs to become an annual tradition, it served as a crucial reminder of how enthralling The Flash can be when it focuses on the lighter side of Barry Allen's life. Hopefully that episode, and the generally improved state of the series in the second half of Season 3, are signs of what to expect when the show returns in the fall.
The Flash: Season 3 is a clear step down from the show's first two years. It's not that there were many truly bad episodes this year, but more that the show struggled too long to find a compelling status quo and make the most of the fallout from "Flashpoint." Some of the best episodes this season had little to do with the overarching Savitar conflict. Luckily, the show did find its footing in the final two months of Season 3, and that strong finish went a long way toward redeeming the season as a whole.

The Isolated Plateau - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Welcome to IGN's Walkthrough for the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This page contains information on the second main quest - The Isolated Plateau. 
Breath of the Wild is a very open-ended game, a first for the series. As such, the guide below is just one of many possible ways you can experience the game. We recommend you take time to explore the world at large in-between the main objectives you are given. 
 


Video Guide: The Isolated Plateau (Shrine Oman Au)
Once you have completed the task to Follow the Sheikah Slate, you'll witness a scene from Hyrule Castle, and learn your true goal - to stop Ganon at any cost. 
Climbing down from the Resurrection Tower, you'll spot the Old Man floating down on a neat little contraption. After speaking with him, he'll note that the only way down off the Great Plateau is with the Paraglider he owns. However, he won't just hand it over for nothing. He wants something in return - something that resides in four Shrines that have opened up around the Great Plateau area. Only by seeking out and conquering these shrines can you get 4 Spirit Orbs to trade with him for the Paraglider. 
At this point, where you go and how you attempt these shrines is largely up to you. There's a lot to explore here, enemies to fight, treasure chests to open, and much more. This walkthrough will give you the most direct route to each shrine and how to complete them. 
One of the first shrines you can undertake is pointed out to you by the Old Man. It's located just North of the Resurrection Tower, just across a broken bridge and small pond. 
Entering the Shrine you'll see a large locked gate before you, and several metal tiles on the floor. To the left of the gate is a pedestal you can place your Sheikah Slate on to gain access to the Magnesis Rune. With this rune, you'll be able to manipulate metallic objects found both in the shrine and in the world at large. 
Using the Rune, target the metal plates in the middle of the room to lift them off the floor to reveal a path below the gate. Follow the path along the water to climb stairs to the other room. Here you'll find a large stone wall blocking your path, but checking your Magnesis Rune you'll find one of the blocks is in fact metal. Wrangle it with the rune to push aside the blocks creating a new path. 
On the other side of this path lurks a Mini Guardian. While not as imposing as the larger Guardians, this Mini Guardian can still deal major damage with its timed laser blast. Use the metal block as cover - at which point you can take it out either with your weapon, or by using the Magnesis Rune to send the block crashing into the Mini Guardian, or even shove it off into the water below causing it to explode. 
With the defenses gone, cross the metal slab onto the next platform - though the platform beyond has no bridge. You can use the Magnesis Rune again to drag the plate from behind you to form a new path ahead. If you fall off into the water below - note that the walls are too smooth to climb, so you'll have to create a bridge up using the slab. 
Note: If you look to the left, you can spy a chest high up on a platform. There's no feasible way to get to it - but why not bring the chest to you? Since it's made of metal, you can target it with the Magenesis Rune and bring it down to you, where you can open it for a Traveler's Bow. 
In front of you lurks the last defense - a large metal door. Noting the marks on the floor, pull - don't push - the doors open, and speak with the monk Oman Au to complete the shrine and gain a Spirit Orb. 
 


Video Guide: The Isolated Plateau (Shrine Ja Baij)
Shrine Ja Baij is located in the Eastern area of the Great Plateau, just to the South of the Resurrection Tower in the Eastern Abbey ruins. You can make your way there from the previous Shrine by either heading down past the tower into the side of the ruins, or back towards the Temple of Time to spot the abbey below. 
It is guarded by a half-functioning Guardian that cannot move but will shoot its laser for an extreme amount of damage. Since the shrine is located in an enclosed area behind it, you can either sneak past the Guardian and climb the walls, or trick the Guardian into blasting the walls apart. 
As you enter the Shrine, you'll find a large sealed wall in front of you at the end of a slope. The cracks in the wall imply it can be destroyed - but you need something to do that with. Look for the pedestal on the left and place the Shiekah Slate to gain the ability to use Remote Bombs. 
These bombs - that come in both sphere and cube form - can be placed and detonated at any time, although there is a small delay between detonation and being able to place a new bomb. Spherical bombs are great for throwing or rolling down slopes, while cubic bombs are better suited to precise locations where you need the bomb to stay. Place one at the end of the ramp to break the wall leading to a hallway. 
Note: From the hallway, take a right first to find another small sealed and cracked wall. Detonate a bomb here to find a hidden alcove where a chest lies that holds a Traveler's Sword. 
Look for two large cracked stones on the left and detonate a bomb next to them to reveal a ladder going back up. Up in the next room you'll find a moving platform that crosses a small gap over to a sheer wall with cracked stones. Since you can't place a bomb at the foot of the wall, you'll need to place a Cube Bomb at the end of the moving platform and wait back on the other side until the bomb is in place to blow it up. 
The next area is large and may look a little confusing. Small ramps lead to funnels that end up on slanted platforms with blocks that will burst out forcefully. Head up onto the platform on the right next to the first funnel, and place a Sphere Bomb into the funnel, which will place it on a ramp that gets shotput over to the other side - on top of a cracked stone blocking a ladder you can reveal by detonation. 
Note: Over on the opposite side are two more giant blocks that extend and retract. Stand on the furthest one to get launched to the other side of the pit where you can find a chest holding a Soldier's Bow. 
Now you can jump into the pit and climb the ladder on the far side to reach the monk Ja Baij to get the next Spirit Orb. 
 


Video Guide: The Isolated Plateau (Shrine Owa Daim)
One of the next shrines you can go to is located in Southern area of the Great Plateau, up at the top of a steep cliff at the southeastern side of Mount Hylia. 
You can either climb up the hills behind the Temple of Time, or climb up from the cliffs near the farm house on the southern tip of the region - You'll have to cross a small ravine by chopping down a tree, then climb up the cliff face on the other side, using the small platforms along the way up to catch your stamina. 
Note that if you take the route behind the Temple of Time, you'll be crossing into icy territory, and Link won't be able to survive long on his own. Look for a patch of Spicy Pepper by the archway leading to the frozen tundra, and either eat or cook them to gain temporary cold resistance as you trek to the shrine. 
Entering the shrine you'll find it to be almost clockwork in its design - with many moving parts and gears moving platforms in a large hall. In particular the moving platform ahead will move too rapidly for you to cross - so inspect the pedestal to the left with your Sheikah Slate to obtain the Stasis Rune. 
Using this rune, you can freeze certain objects - either to stop moving parts from advancing, or to build up momentum on an object when Stasis is released. 
Using the Stasis Rune, target the large gear on the left and freeze it when the platform that it's spinning is straight, and run across. 
Be wary as you move into this next section, as the hall up ahead is configured to launch giant boulders down a ramp - and will smack into you and likely toss you over the ledge. Instead, wait for one to pass and start moving up, and ready your Stasis Rune to freeze the next boulder that drops further up - letting you run up the path and to the side as the boulder resumes. 
Note: As the boulder passes you, freeze it again with the Stasis Rune and continue running up the slope past where the boulder drops to reach a higher platform where a treasure chest awaits. 
From the first platform, take a left to find a stationary boulder blocking the path. Nearby, look for a Iron Sledgehammer and equip it. Now, use the Stasis Rune on the boulder and start smacking it with your sledgehammer. You'll note that while in Stasis, the boulder is building momentum signaled by an increasing arrow the more you hit it. When Statis breaks, the boulder will launch into the air, revealing the path. 
Cross the bridge and speak to Monk Owa Daim to gain your next Spirit Orb. 
 


Video Guide: The Isolated Plateau (Shrine Keh Namut)

The final Shrine located in the Western area of the Great Plateau, up at the top of Mount Hylia, just South of where Hylia River flows into a waterfall leaving the plateau. There's several ways to get up to the shrine from around Hylia River - like using a Deku Leaf to cross on a raft, or hiking up South of the Temple of Time - but you'll either need spicy food like Spicy Pepper or warm clothing to survive the cold. 
Be sure to stop by the very top of Mount Hylia, where you should come upon the Old Man, who will give you a Quilted Tunic so you won't have to keep shoving peppers down your mouth. 
Entering the Shrine, you'll find the way forward out of reach on a high ledge below a pool of water. Instead, look for a pedestal to the left an use your Sheikah Slate to gain the Cryonis Rune. This rune can be used to create blocks and platforms made of ice from any pool of water. 
Now with the rune, use the Cryonis power to create a platform in the pool of water to jump up and onto the ledge. 
The gate blocking the player's path in the next section can be raised by creating an ice pillar directly beneath the gate - pushing up the block to open the gate. 
On the other side of the gate, a Mini Guardian waits for you. Not as imposing as the larger variants, but the laser blasts can still sting. You can engage it, shoot with arrows, and also create blocks of ice to use as cover. 
The final section of the trial can be cleared by placing an ice pillar beneath either side of the raised platform allowing the player to reach the raised level. 
Note: After climbing up to the upper platform, look to the right of the stairs to the Monk. There's a chest hiding in an alcove - and you can place an ice platform to jump to to let you cross to the treasure chest. 
Cross the bridge up to Monk Keh Namut. There, the player can talk to Ke Numut who gives you a Spirit Orb. 
 


Video Guide: The Isolated Plateau

Once you have completed all four shrines, the Old Man will appear before you again, but before you can claim your reward, he will ask that you find him where the four shrines cross on the map. Looking at your map, all four shrines seem to converge around the area of the Temple of Time - so head over there.

The Legend of Zelda Symphony Concert Series Kicks Off This October - IGN

At Nintendo's E3 2011 press conference last month, the company announced plans to celebrate The Legend of Zelda's 25th anniversary with a special symphony concert series. Today more details were revealed, including that the first concert will be held at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles on October 21 of this year, followed by a full tour in 2012.
"The Legend of Zelda has few peers in the pantheon of video game giants, and the games and their music have always shared a deep connection," said Scott Moffitt, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of Sales & Marketing. "Through these concerts, fans nationwide will be able to gather and show their love for the quarter century of action, adventure and excitement that The Legend of Zelda games have brought to their lives."
The Zelda songs that will be included in the concert were hand-picked by legendary video game composer Koji Kondo himself, best known for his scores for The Legend of Zelda and Mario series. A 70-piece orchestra, joined by full choir, will perform new arrangements of these classic tunes. The concerts will be produced by Jason Michael Paul Productions, the producers of PLAY! A Video Game Symphony.
"The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert Tour brings one of the video game industry's most exciting and enduring franchises to the concert hall and presents what we feel is the definitive concert experience for the series," said executive producer Jason Michael Paul. "It's an event that fans and music aficionados won't want to miss."

The Legends Behind The Legend of Zelda - IGN

March 3rd, 2016: To celebrate the return of Twilight Princess, now in HD on Wii U, we look back at the creative minds behind the epic franchise.
The biggest names behind The Legend of Zelda need little introduction. Any fan of the series, indeed any follower of the game industry on the whole, knows about Shigeru Miyamoto. By the same stroke, Eiji Aonuma is established far and wide as the second biggest name in Zelda history, having risen from the somewhat obscure Marvelous: Another Treasure Island to direct and produce many games in the series. Takashi Tezuka is another major talent, known for his influence on both Mario and Zelda games. And any Zelda follower could extoll the talents of composer Koji Kondo, whose music was part of the series since the original The Legend of Zelda hit the Famicom Disk System in 1986.

The Long Journey Home Review - IGN

According to one of my playthroughs of the roguelike The Long Journey Home, humanity's first meeting with an alien species took place between the crew of our first interstellar vessel and a squat little glukkt trader named Mendarch. Here it was: the chance of enlightenment and the promise of advances in science beyond our wildest dreams. There was a whole unspoken history in his calling our place the galaxy the "prohibited sector." And what were the fruits of that first mission? He offered to loan me 600 galactic credits and only told me that he expected 200 credits in interest after we finished the transaction. Aliens will be human, I guess.

The Shrine of Resurrection - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Welcome to IGN's Walkthrough for the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This page contains information on the opening scenes of the game - located in The Shrine of Resurrection. 
Breath of the Wild is a very open-ended game, a first for the series. As such, the guide below is just one of many possible ways you can experience the game. We recommend you take time to explore the world at large in-between the main objectives you are given. 
 


Video Walkthrough: Shrine of Resurrection
When the game begins, a distant voice will bid Link to open his eyes. Link will awaken in a mysterious chamber from a platform that drains as he wakes. The room is empty, save for a sealed door and a curious pedestal off in the corner. 
Inspecting the pedestal, you'll find the Sheikah Slate. This important tool has a lot of features that you'll become accustomed to over time. This includes a map, a built-in viewfinder that lets you scan targets and place markers - and the ability to use both Runes and Amiibo. 
With the Sheikah Slate in hand, the far door will open, bidding you to exit the Shrine. The hall beyond if full of old rotting crates and barrels - but two chests still stand unopened. Open each for Well-Worn Trousers and an Old Shirt. In Breath of the Wild, you won't be limited to just a green tunic anymore. There are several types of Attires across the land, and both shirts and pants come in many kinds, offer different defense values -a and sometimes added bonus effects. 
You're also welcome to go without clothing - just expect to take a lot more damage and get cold faster! 
To leave the shrine, check out the pedestal near the sealed door, where the voice will bid you to place the Sheikah Slate on it to open up the door. The voice will beg you to be the hero once more, and send you on your way. 
As you reach a rock wall with the ledge above, note that you can climb almost any surface. Doing so will slowly drain your stamina (the green wheel). So long as you climb to the top before it runs out, you'll be able to climb up to the ledge above. Keep this in mind as you explore the large world before you. 
There's a lot to take in as you finally exit the shrine and see the world laid out before you. You stand on the Great Plateau, isolated from the rest of Hyrule. There's a lot to explore here, but to get down you are going to need some help. Looking to the right you can spot a mysterious figure along the path down. 
If you want to head down the path on the right, be sure to grab the Tree Branch on the ground. This is one of the many Weapons you can find in the game, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Note that all weapons have a set durability as well as damage output, and some weapons - like the branch - won't last long in combat before breaking. Be sure to look out for several weapons in your adventures so you can have backups ready if your chosen weapon breaks. 
The path down also holds certain types of Food and Ingredients. These things, like the Apple or Hylian Shroom can be quickly consumed to restore hearts - as you won't be finding any by cutting grass in this iteration of Zelda. Note that food and ingredients can also be cooked to increase their effectiveness - so stockpile whatever you find. 
As you reach the mysterious Old Man sitting by a campfire, you'll have the chance to talk to him (or not) to learn a bit more about where you are, and he'll point out a nearby ruin. Be sure to help yourself to the Torch against the wall, and a Woodcutter's Axe nearby - both will be useful in your adventure. While both can be used as weapons, the Torch can be used to light thing on fire - like tall grass or unlit campfires, while the axe can be used to chop down trees and make firewood. 
It won't be long now until you are given your next objective: Follow the Sheikah Slate, but until then, we recommend checking out the ruins of the Temple of Time nearby. There's some pretty good loot to find in chests around the area - like one containing Hylian Trousers in a ruin near the temple. 
You can also fight your first enemies - Bokoblins. These little red goblins will use whatever is lying around as a weapon, so engage with caution. Note that if you dodge their strike at the right time, you can perform a flurry attack in slow motion. If you have a shield, you can parry at the right moment to totally disarm them - or send any projectiles racing back to your enemy. 
After a few minutes wandering the wilds, you'll be interrupted with a new task: Follow the Sheikah Slate.

The Surge Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
The Surge is an action-RPG that features innovative combat mechanics and an original character progression system based on modular upgrades gained through tight, visceral combat. Set in a heavily dystopian future as Earth nears the end of its life, those who remain in the overpopulated cities must work to survive as social programs become saturated by an ageing population and increasing environmental diseases. As the intelligence of technology incrementally increased over the years, many jobs for the human race had been made redundant, forcing Earth's citizens to head out into the suburbs seeking labor, aided by exoskeletons to improve their efficiency. The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.

The Visual History of The Legend of Zelda - IGN

Nintendo's Legend of Zelda is one of the most long-running and storied franchises in video game history.
And while that longevity is impressive on its own, Zelda is especially notable thanks to Nintendo's ceaseless dedication to quality. Although some entries shine brighter than others, there's simply never been a bad main-line Zelda game - in almost 30 years. Pretty incredible.
Visually, Nintendo seems to have no interest in changing some of Zelda's most iconic elements. Link is still Link, green tunic and all. But besides of a few key icons, the company largely seems willing to reinvent Zelda's visual identity time and time again. From 2D to 3D and back, from pixels to 3D, to toon Link and back to realism, almost every Zelda game is instantly recognizable thanks to its visuals alone. Let's take a look:
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
The Legend of Zelda on the NES might not look like much today, but many of the enemy designs, and of course Link himself, are still being drawn from to this day.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
Zelda II added an experimental 2D side-scrolling viewpoint for exploring dungeons and towns. Whether it worked effectively or not depends on who you ask.
 poilib start 
 poilib end 
A Link to the Past returned to the classic overhead Zelda perspective, but with far more personality and detail thanks to the power of the still-new SNES. Gamers are still questioning why Nintendo gave Link pink hair, though. Or is it the brim of his hat? The debate rages.

Things Arms Doesn't Tell You - Arms for Nintendo Switch Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
There's a lot to learn when trying to become the best fighter in Arms, and while there are plenty of Training Modes and tips to check out - there are few Things Arms Doesn't Tell You (or aren't shown or explained very well). 
Have you discovered something that Arms doesn't explain very well? Share it with us in the comments! 
Buried in the help menu is a controls tooltip that shows an easily missed yet important fact: In matches vs. multiple opponents (like 2v2 or 1v100) you can press a certain button to face a different target. 
This is hugely important in chaotic battles where you need to quickly focus on someone else - and may end up securing victory for yourself or your team. The button depends on your current controller: 
Though it's been hinted at - there is a way to manually change the color of your fighter's wardrobe. 
When selecting a character for any mode, hold in on the left analogue stick, and while pressed in, angle it in one of four directions before pressing the button to select a fighter. If done correctly, your character will be selected with one of four distinct colors. 
Not a fan of the button layout for punching with B and A? You can use ZR and ZL when using the Switch, Joy Con Grip, or Pro Controller instead of pressing the other buttons. Give it a try! 
While not the best button layout - it is possible to play Arms with just one Joy-Con Controller, which is best used when playing local or online with two players on one Switch. 
When using a Joy-Con by itself, you'll have to tilt the controller sideways to play, and can only use the buttons to punch (And L and R to activate burst mode). 
In team matches, nothing is worse than your partner getting thrown across the arena and you getting dragged along for the ride thanks to the tether. Thankfully, if you notice your partner is about to get grabbed, you can interrupt the grab by attacking the opponent and stunning them - pulling them out of a grab and letting your teammate go free. 
During a match, you may notice that not all throws are equal - certain characters have more powerful throws than others, and some will deal considerably more damage. Most fighters will deal a standard 150 damage (around half of one of the three-part health bars you have), while certain fighters deal increased damage:

Things Mass Effect: Andromeda Doesn't Tell You - Mass Effect Andromeda Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Mass Effect: Andromeda features many menus and systems. Some of those have their own secrets. Use these tools and tricks for a smoother exploration and combat experience and get more information about your Ryder in Andromeda. 
Consumables exist! Equip up to four in your loadout (you get two slots when you start) and use them in the weapons menu. Consumables include things like incendiary ammo, cryo ammo, and shield capacitors. 
Ryder can buy and discover consumables in containers. Enemies occasinally drop them as well. 
Save a set of skills and your chosen profile in the Favorites wheel to easily swap between multiple skills. Save a favorite skills loadout in the Skills and Profile menus. The button that pulls up the Favorites menu is listed on the bottom right corner of that menu. You can access the Favorites in the weapons and consumables quick menu. Check out your controls settings to find out which button that is for you. 
This is never explained in a pop-up tutorial, but Ryder is able to quick-cycle through their equipped weapons while in combat, instead of constantly having to use the weapon menu. 
Just hold down X on XB1 or Square on PS4 to switch to your next weapon. 
Things Resident Evil 7 Doesn't Tell You - Resident Evil 7 Biohazard Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, the unknown can be terrifying - and sometimes even confusing. Below you will find a collection of tips and tricks for things not overtly told to the player in Resident Evil. Note that some tips mentioned have been taken from the tooltips after a player dies - hopefully with the following hints you won't have to see them in game! 
There are certain Weapons you can find in RE7 that are classified as Melee Weapons. You'll find that they do little damage, but many can be used in a pinch to conserve ammo - or when no other weapons are present. 
Every melee weapon can be used with two hands if the player holds the left trigger (aiming button) first - and will usually perform a stab instead of a wild swing. This can be better for precision hits to target specific parts of the body. In the case of the Chainsaw, it can be used to perform a continuous charge attack that can be extremely useful at times. 
At certain points in your adventure, you may find enemies like the Molded appearing in different rooms or halls as you progress. Sometimes they can be a real pain to take on, especially when they stand in the way of useful items. However, if you decide to bypass the fight and run past - you may find that they leave some areas after certain events of the game. This can help exploration later in the game to see if you've missed anything without having to worry about enemies. 
It's well known that zombies and related monsters aren't so great at opening doors. The same holds true for the Molded creatures you find in RE7. So long as doors are closed before they reach them (you can quickly close a door you passed through by moving backwards and pressing the interact button while looking at the door), you can't be followed. 
However, certain... unique enemies have no such qualms about chasing you through doors - or even making other entrances. Against these enemies, the only escape you'll find lies in Safe Rooms: rooms that have a Tape Recorder and Storage box. These unrelenting enemies will decide against following you inside, giving you breathing room whether you closed the door or not. 
You may find some weapons in the game that are not usable in their current state. Rest assured, Broken Weapons are still weapons - but they require a Repair Kit to make them usable. These Broken Weapons are often much more powerful than what you've been using, but you'll need to be on the lookout as Repair Kits are well hidden. 
Speaking of better weapon types, you may find yourself with multiple variants of the same weapon type that all share an ammo type: Handgun Ammo or Shotgun Shells. It's worth noting that when picking a different weapon variant to use, you won't be able to swap out ammo already loaded in a gun's clip. For those who rely on conserving ammo, you may want to finish emptying a clip and avoid reloading before switching to the new weapon. 
The Molded are resilient enemies that can sometimes take more ammo to kill than is healthy. While destroying their head is the only surefire way to make them stay down quickly, you can shoot off other body parts as well. Blowing off arms will give them less opportunities to swipenis, and shooting out their legs will force them to crawl. While they can still deal damage, you should have more time and feel less threatened as you go in for the kill - or run past them. 
Viewing a VHS Tape will allow you to relive (and control) the events of the footage you witness. Most times you'll have a very specific or simple task - but know that in some of these tapes, you may be able to interact with the environment that may leave a lasting impact on your adventure. This can even cause some time-travel paradoxes, as unlocking something in the past will cause it to be unlocked in the present, even if you've already seen the locked container. 
There are certain enemies in this game that are a little more imposing than others. These types of special enemies you'll find aren't really fazed by most attacks, and will hunt you almost relentlessly. In these situations, staying out of sight and running away is a better strategy than trying to fight a losing battle. 
However, there may be some points where there's nowhere left to run. If you ever find yourself in these sorts of arenas with no feasible escape route, know that it's kill or be killed, and you'll just have to fight until they drop - hopefully for good. 
Resident Evil 7 contains three different types of Collectibles. If you wish to find them on your own, you should know that many are cleverly hidden - some are even found in areas you'll only traverse briefly, and can never return to. Be diligent in your searches, and don't be fooled into believing there's a place that's not worth searching!

Things to Do First in Breath of the Wild - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you'll find that the game is expansive and vast - a first for the series. As such, it's easy to get lost and miss out on some great things to find or do early in the game. That's why we've listed Things to Do First in Breath of the Wild. 
Remember that you can play this game any way you want, so feel free to experiment, explore, and have fun! 
On the Great Plateau, you'll soon find that some regions have more extreme temperatures than others. You can circumvent these hazardous weather environments through clever use of cooking and making elixirs - but you can also wear warmer clothing. 
One such piece of clothing - the Quilted Doublet, is available on the Great Plateau, and you can get it through several different methods. If you check the Southeast of the region you can find the hut belonging to the Old Man. His diary states that he made a dish but can't remember the ingredients he used. If you find and cook a Hot Pepper, Raw Meat, and Hyrule Bass, you can make his lost recipe. Show it to him, and he'll give the doublet to you for free. You can also brave your way to the top of Mount Hylia where you'll happen upon the Old Man again, and he'll reward you for getting up this high without warm clothing with the doublet. 
If you miss out on getting the clothes by the conclusion of the quests on the plateau, return to the Old Man's hut and you'll find that he's left it for you regardless. 
It goes without saying, but every ingredient you can find in the world serves a purpose - many serve multiple purposes! If ever you should see something sparkling by a tree, on a cliff, or just lying in the grass - be sure to stop and grab it. Your ingredient inventory is unlimited, so go nuts, and experiment with cooking to make the perfect meals. 
Wandering around the Great Plateau, you'll mostly have only wooden sticks and clubs to fight off Bokoblin hordes. Pay attention and look for chests or tougher enemies to build up your aresenal. A few chests in the Temple of Time have good bows, while you can also find an axe at the Old Man's hut, and a Sledgehammer in one of the Shrines on the cliff above his hut. 
Be sure to explore as you leave the plateau, for weapons are often found in optional chests when doing Shrines, and you can always find something to use in villages and stables. 
Ever notice something out of place in the world? A ring of stones or lillies in a pond? A small stone convinently placed on a lone plateau? Check around, and you'll probably run into one of the many Koroks in Hyrule. They'll reward you with a Korok Seed if you find them - and trust us, they're worth collecting. Which brings us to the next topic... 
On the road to Kakariko Village, be sure to keep an eye out for a very large and conspicuous Korok named Hestu. He'll need your help with something, and if you give him aid, he'll reward you by offering to increase inventory space for weapons, bows, and shields - but requires Korok Seeds to do so!

Tips and Tricks - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page collects tips and tricks, strategies, and secrets you need to succeed in Horizon Zero Dawn, from which weapons you should by to how to kill machines. 
Here you will find tips, strategies and advice that applies can be used throughout a playthrough of Horizon. 
This may seem obvious, but sometimes we forget to stop and smell the roses - or, more accurately, stop and collect the life-saving herbs. 
The woods, deserts, mountains and jungles of Horizon are full of medicinal plants - always be sure to grab a few if your healing satchel is running low! 
When fighting larger bots, make use of the I-frames that occur in the first second of a dodge/roll. 
I-frames, or invincibility frames, sometimes occur during the beginning of a quick player motion - they allow a brief moment of time where the player character is invulnerable to damage. 
When you find a new merchant, navigate to the Treasure Boxes section of their sale menu. Every vendor offers a Free Sample Box with some basic items inside.  
Larger machines, such as Ravagers or Behemoths, have multiple vulnerable spots that can be removed or damaged. You can see these by clicking the Right Stick and scanning the enemy -- all vulnerable parts are highlighted in yellow. Hit the touch pad to enter the full menu and you can look up elemental vulnerabilities for each part in the Notebook section. 
Focus on certain types of items - most notably Power Cells or Cryo Cannisters - to do a massive amount of damage to these dangerous robo-beasts. 
When you reach the end of a Cauldron, there's almost always a formidable machine waiting to be released against you. Before triggering this boss fight, be sure to plant traps and tripwires all around the creature's enclosure. 
This will either cause it to be stunned or damaged as soon as it breaks free, or it will simply stay inside the makeshift pen, allowing you to pick it off from a distance. 
Save at a fire before entering a Cauldron. You may be trapped there with a boss stronger than you and forced to revert to your outside save. 
If you Quicksave before a battle and die, your life will be fully restored along with any weapons you are holding that were dropped by a machine (e.g. Thunderjaw or Ravager). 
If you die before collecting loot after a big battle, your loot will disappear. 
If you fight machines for 30 minutes and die without saving, you will be returned to the last fire you saved at. Don't let that happen. Autosaves happen in quests, however. 
There are three tiers of weapon: Basic (green), Carja (blue), Shadow (purple). You can purchase Shadow weapons in the big, central city Meridian fairly early in the game. Definitely upgrade: This is how you add elemental ammo types like ice arrows. 
Hunter Bow seeming painfully weak? The Shadow Hunter Bow (see above) has Hardpoint Arrows that do significant damage. 
If you encounter a machine with a weakness to fire, pelt it with arrows until it catches on fire. Suddenly your arrows will do vastly more damage. 
 


These are the tips you'll want to know before starting and during the first few hours of your adventure through the post-post-apocalyptic world of Horizon Zero Dawn. 
After completing the tutorial missions A Gift From the Past and Lessons of the Wild, Aloy will possess three skill points to unlock new abilities with. 
We recommend purchasing Silent Strike, Concentration and Lure Call as your starting skills. Silent Strike and Lure Call work well in tandem to allow you to eliminate nearby machines without engaging or alarming the ones nearby. Concentration functions similarly, allowing you more time to line up bow shots - this is especially useful for taking out Watchers before they can raise an alarm. 
One of the first things you'll want to improve is your carrying capacity. We specifically recommend focusing on crafting upgrades for your Resource Satchel first, since this will allow you to carry more items you scavenge from enemies and around the world. 
You'll spend the first few hours of the game in The Embrace - this is the best location for hunting wildlife in the game, since the Machines in this area are less threatening than anywhere else. After completing the tutorial missions, spend some time hunting boar, turkey, rabbits, foxes and fish - you'll need their pelts and bones to craft more elaborate satchels and pouches. 
After leveling up a few more times, you'll want to focus your skill points on purchasing abilities in the third column of the Forager skill tree. 
 


The Gatherer and Scavenger skills are helpful for crafting, and Disarm Traps is helpful, too ( being able to collect unused traps and tripwires is a great relief on resource management). The Tinker ability, however, may be the most important one in the (later) game, as it allows you to keep modifications when removing them from weapons and outfits instead of destroying them. 
After acquiring a new weapon or ammo type, be sure to enter your Quest menu and set the newly-added Tutorial quest as active, then complete a single final objective. For example: That means that you can kill 2 boars out of three, but you'll need to kill the third one while the quest is active for it to count. 
This is a great way to earn bonus XP quickly, helping you power through the early levels of the game. 
It may seem daunting, but being able to recognize a machine's vulnerabilities without your Focus will be a valuable skill during combat. 
 


Scan every machine you encounter and take note of where their vulnerabilities lie -- and what types of damage will be most effective against them! 
Outifts, weapons and special items are cheap in the world of Horizon - don't be stingy and hold onto every single item that you scavenge early on. 
You can trade them to merchants for currency or better items, and if you run out you can always acquire more. 
 


There are five hidden power cells to be found throughout the main campaign that will trigger a special side quest to unlock some very powerful armor. Keep your eyes peeled during your journey - or find them all here. 
While you can get through the early stages of the game with only your Hunter Bow and Tripcaster, make sure to purchase a Carja Sharpshot from the traders past the Embrace gate. 
It's TearBlast arrows will prove invaluable against larger machines - especially Ravagers, Glinthawks and ThunderJaws. 
If you trust your ability to tackle any foe with merely a bow and some tripwires, don't bother purchasing a Ropecaster from any of the vendors - you'll receive a free one during the quest Maker's End (though it is several hours into the main storyline). 
For a game that contains so many optional tutorials, there's a surprising amount of information that Horizon Zero Dawn either explains poorly or forgets to tell players entirely. 
Different weapons all require different ammo types. You may say "Well, DUH," but this also applies to the quality of the various weapons as well. TearBlast arrows, for example, can only be used with the Carja or Shadow Sharpshot Bow, and while the basic Tripcaster can use shock tripwires, only the Shadow version can utilize flaming ones. 
Be sure you examine what ammo types a weapon is able to fire before purchasing. 
Much like in other large open world titles, when Aloy overrides a Strider, Broadhead or Charger to use as a mount, they will attempt to follow the path of whatever roadway they're traveling on, without players having to steer them along. 
All players are responsible for is maintaining speed and defending against / avoiding nearby enemies. 
When in a quest or activity that requires you to travel on foot with an NPC, you can walk, run or sprint at whatever speed you like - the other characters traveling with you will move at your pace. 
Aloy can learn to override new, more powerful machines throughout the world by venturing into Cauldrons and hacking into their power core. These dungeon-like subterranean chambers are usually occupied by Watchers (and some larger creatures) and have a more dangerous machine guarding their core. 
While there is a side quest that leads Aloy to her first Cauldron, it's easy to bypass if you aren't engaging in every optional mission you encounter. 
Aloy can fast-travel between campsites that she's discovered, but doing so uses 1 Fast-Travel Pack. 
These resources can be purchased or crafted from resources, and there are vendors in Meridian and other large settlements who possess Golden Fast Travel Packs, which allow for unlimited fast traveling. 
While exploring caverns, bunkers and abandoned buildings of the Old Ones, Aloy will occasionally encounter doors blocked by rock formations. 
She can destroy these stalagmites and stalactites with her spear to gain access to these closed-off areas. 
Depending on how many resources you're carrying, it may not be worth crafting those last few arrows to hit max ammo. 
Each stack of ammunition, whether you're crafting two or 12 individual arrows, costs the same amount of resources. So if you've got 37/40 arrows, it's not worth wasting the 10 Metal Shards required to craft an ammo pack that will only yield two arrows.

Tokyo 42 Official Multiplayer Trailer - IGN Video

Tokyo 42 Review - IGN

When played strictly as a stealth game, Tokyo 42 is a total blast. As a killer for hire in the stylish, high-contrast high rise setting of future Tokyo, I delighted in silently slashing guards with my katana blade on my way to take out a mob boss in the top floor of a beautifully ornate temple or plant a series of explosives along a tangle of factory pipelines. Unfortunately, once my cover was blown and the shooting started, Tokyo 42 became a wildly inconsistent experience thanks to targeting controls that miss when they seem like they should hit and AI that hits when it seems like it should miss. And in a game where you can be killed with only one shot, you really need the controls to work for you rather than against you.

Towns and Settlements - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the people of Hyrule have managed to live on past the Calamity and dwell in major Towns and Settlements across the land. 
Along with the Hylians, the other races of Hyrule: The Zora, Rito, Goron, and Gerudo all have their own towns in which they dwell. 
Towns serve as hub areas - both to advance the plot of the main quest to Free the Divine Beast, and offer a place to rest, shop for good, and obtain Side Quests and Shrine Quests by talking to the residents of the towns and settlements. 
For detailed information on what you can find in each town, see the list below:

Trading Items - The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Trading Items provide another quest for Link. You don't have to participate, but if you do, you'll reap a powerful Sword upgrade which will make the rest of the game much easier. Although you can trade items as you go along, I suggest doing it all at once. 
1. CuccodexGet this from Dr. Left after you light his torch for him. 
2. Lon Lon EggGive the Cuccodex to Malon to the north of Horon Village. She'll give you the Lon Lon Egg. 
3. Ghastly DollRun into Maple with the Egg in your possession and she'll give you the Ghastly Doll. 
4. Iron PotTake the Ghastly Doll to the mayor's wife Mrs. Ruul. She will give you an Iron Pot. 
5. Lava SoupGo into the Chef's Kitchen in Subrosia. Give him the Iron Pot and he'll give you Lava Soup. 
6. Goron VaseGive the Lava Soup to Biggoron atop Goron Mountain in order to get the Goron Vase. 
7. FishGo to Sunken City and find Ingo's house. Show him the Goron Vase and he'll zonk you a Fish. 
8. MegaphoneTake the Fish to the area near Eyeglass Lake. Here, you'll meet an old man trying to get his cat out of the tree. Use the Fish to get the cat down and the man will give you a Megaphone. 
9. Mushroom Go to Mount Cucco and change the season to spring, then use the flower to get up to the high ledge. Go into the cave entrance and wake the sleeping guy inside with your Megaphone. This is Talon. He'll give you a Mushroom. 
10. Wooden BirdVisit Syrup. She'll see the Mushroom and complete her Potion. For your help, she'll hook you up with a Wooden Bird. 
11. Engine GreaseGo back to Horon Village and go to the clock shop. Give the Wooden Bird to the clockmaker, and he'll give you the Engine Grease. 
12. PhonographTake the Engine Grease to the Windmill. Go to the top of the mill and talk to the man here. He'll take your Grease and give you a Phonograph. Great trade! 
Final ItemOnce you have the Phonograph, go through the Tarm Ruins to the Lost Woods. Play the Phonograph for the music-loving Deku Scrub and he'll give you instructions on how to get the Noble Sword. Move to the stump to the left and change the season to Winter. Head west in the Winter, west in the Autumn, west in the Spring and west in the Summer. You'll end up at a secret location, where you'll receive the Noble Sword.

Treasure Battle - Tekken 7 Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
 


Treasure Battle is similar to Arcade Mode, but with a few key differences that will garner a lot of attention from everyone. In Treasure Battles, you fight against an endless amount of opponents and gain Fight Money and customization items for each victory you obtain. Match victories reward you with Treasure Chests that unlock to reveal new items that get added to the customization menu. 
You can select any character and will have a chance to gain a wide number of costumes and extra items for the entire roster of fighters. As you win more matches in Treasure Battle, you gain a larger multiplier for the amount of Fight Money you win, as well as gain more chances to get more Treasure chests per match. 
The rarity of items and frequency of them also increases as you win more consecutive matches. You can win a maximum of three chests per match if you are lucky enough to win enough matches. 
 
At random points while you're playing Treasure Battle, you'll occassionally be faced with a match that has a modifer on it. Both fighters will either gain a massive damage boost to their attacks, or they will be fighting at turbo speed. When this happens, you just have to win the match like normal to continue onward, but you'll have to deal with the modifiers as well. 
When you win a match with a Turbo or Damage boost, you also gain a bonus in fight money earned at the end of the match. This can range anywhere between 10,000G ro 20,000G when you win. 
About every 3 - 4 matches that you win, you have a chance to partake in a Special Battle against a specific boss character. These fights are somewhat different since your opponent has boosted abilities that make them stronger and faster, but also give you a chance to score super rare customization items and more fight money. 
There are a total of four different special battles you can have. You can fight Heihachi, Kasumi, Devil Kazuya, or Akuma. Each one has their own version of armored attacks and buffed up abilities that make fighting them more difficult than other battles. Defeating them will net you better rewards, but you'll have to work hard for them.

Trove Review - IGN

Trove is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game created with the same brightly colored voxels that define Minecraft, and it's an appropriate choice for what it is. Much like the buildings, landscapes, and even characters formed with these blocks, it lacks clear focus, especially when compared to its genre peers. Somehow it manages to exude a degree of flawed appeal even with these shortcomings, although I've found that its pleasures leave the best impressions in small doses.
You can dig through these voxels all you want with a mining laser, but no matter how deep you dig you'd be hard pressed to find a story lurking underneath. Trove kicks off with a cutscene discussing some sort of spat between the sun and the moon, but it drops the concept almost immediately. Roleplay suffers as bit as a result, particularly if you're like me and enjoy having some kind of reason for slaying thousands upon thousands of foes.
No, Trove is more interested in loot than storytelling. Endless, nearly unmanageable loot. It seems to think of itself as an MMORPG with Minecraft trappings, but in structure, it owes far greater debts to Diablo 3's Adventure Mode than World of Warcraft. Seconds after the throwaway cutscene it casts you into a hub that becomes your eternal starting point for every login, and from there it's all about leaping through portals into procedurally generated zones peppered with dungeons and bosses ready to scatter loot.

Updates - The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
This page documents any post-release Updates that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild receives, and any noteworthy patch notes or hidden changes that are made to the game. Nintendo has been notoriously vague about what their updates actually do, see below for details on what we know has changed. 
According to users, the Infinite Arrow Exploit has been patched. Before Update 1.1.2, there was an exploit where you could stand in front of enemy archers and while standing still they would shoot the area around you - letting you get unlimited arrows. This has now been changed, and arrows will stop appearing after around 20 or so. Users can still reset this by fast traveling elsewhere. 
Another stealth update according to users, A glitch was fixed where Wolf Link would be summoned with more than his default 3 hearts - even if the user had not completed the Cave of Trials in Twilight Princess HD. Ordinarily, you would have to complete the Cave of Trials, and the amount of hearts that Wolf Link retained would transfer to how many your companion would have in Breath of the Wild. 
According to Eurogamer and Digital Foundry, the framerate has been improved slightly on the Nintendo Switch version of Breath of the Wild. However, the Wii U did not appear to receive the same framerate fixes.

Upgradable Weapons - Final Fantasy XV Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
In Final Fantasy XV, Noctis can find a variety of rare but potentially powerful Upgradable Weapons throughout the land of Eos. While mildly powerful on their own, these weapons can be given to Cid the Mechanic, an in exchange for certain Treasures, they can be upgraded to become even more powerful in combat - sometimes several times! Many times, upgrading a weapon may take time to prepare, requiring Noctis to go on a different quest or bounty hunt to pass the time. 


See below for a list of weapons, where to find them, and how they can be upgraded.

Weapons - Horizon: Zero Dawn Wiki Guide - IGN

Big Story
Horizon: Zero Dawn is full of weapons. They are your tools of destruction against the machine hordes, and are crucial to your survival. 
Below is our list of Weapons that can be found in Horizon. Each one has it's own use, so make sure to read up on them, so you can find which fits your playstyle best! 
Unlocking weapons in Horizon: Zero Dawn is a rather straightforward process. In order to access better weapons, you simply need to get further in the game. However, when looking to get weapons, sometimes you won't have the required resources. If you encounter this issue, simply hit Square while looking at it at the vendor. This will create a Job, and help you gather the necessary items. 
Blue Weapons (Carja Class) will become available once you reach the second area of the game, commonly known as the Devil's Thirst region. The settlement of Mother's Crown has a vendor who provides several Carja weapons. 
Some early Purple Weapons (Shadow Class) will become available when you reach Daytower. The rest of the Purple Weapons will be purchasable once you reach Meridian. 
Lastly, you can unlock 4 specialty weapons by doing the Hunting Grounds, which are scattered throughout the map. These weapons are one of a kind, and the best in their category. 
The Spear is your primary melee weapon. It cannot be bought or sold. It can be upgraded through various Side Quests. 
The bows are the most plentiful weapon in the game. They offer a wide variety of effects, all with good range and high accuracy. 
The rattlers are short range, burst fire weapons. They are designed for close quarters only, as their accuracy drops off after just a few feet. 
The ropecasters are a form of tether device. They can be used to attach thick cables to machines, pinning them in place. The bigger the machine, the more shots it will take. Useful for locking down fast moving foes, or enemies who just won't back off. 
Slings are slow firing weapons that launch bombs at targets. These bombs then detonate dealing an elemental effect that usually lingers in an area for a short time. Although they deal low base damage, they often deal very high elemental damage. 
The tripcasters, as the name implies, fired large wires designed to trip the enemy. They must be fired between two objects, such as trees and when tripped, will detonate causing various effects. Good for setting up traps with but less practical once a fight begins. 
This is a special weapon that is associated with the Hunting Grounds and can only be obtained through the quests associated with it. This is a short range weapon that fires compressed air, ripping off armor plates on nearby machines.

Why the World Needs a Wonder Woman - IGN

In the worst of times, just as in the best of times, we look to heroes to guide us. Sometimes they stand before us a symbol of hope, or simply a reminder that things aren't as bad as we perceive them to be. Other times, they have the ability to pull us out of the depths of despair with just a kind word of encouragement. A hero can even take you back to a simpler, more optimistic time; a time devoid of shades of grey and moral complexity. A time when good could decisively triumph over evil. Today, more than ever, we need a hero that can raise our spirits and remind us that love and compassion are all humanity needs in order to find peace. That hero is Wonder Woman.
Something to consider when thinking of many comics heroes is how they were created to empower the most vulnerable and powerless among us: children. Each of us who gravitated towards superheroes as a child did so, whether we realized it or not, because they had the power to make things better. They didn't need permission, and they weren't at the mercy of anyone else. They were powerful, fearless, and courageous in the face of unspeakable evil.
In the case of Wonder Woman, she took that feeling of empowerment a step further. Not only did her books give children another fantastical hero to idolize, but she also stood as, perhaps, the singular example of a super heroine in the early years of her creation. She gave little girls and women everywhere a champion to cherish.

Wonder Woman: Cinematographer Matthew Jensen Compares the New Film to Donner's Superman, Batman Begins - IGN

A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of speaking with Matthew Jensen, the cinematographer for Wonder Woman. Jensen, whose previous credits include Chronicle, Fantastic Four, Filth and episodes of Game of Thrones, True Blood and Ray Donovan, spoke in glowing terms of star Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins. He also described the film as something intended to be on par with Richard Donner's iconic Superman and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.
He and I also discussed some nagging questions I, as a layperson, have always had about cinematography. And the subject of the Fantastic Four remake, which he also worked on, came up as well. Read on for our full chat...

World of Warcraft Gold Can Be Used to Buy Destiny 2 - IGN

Activision has announced that Destiny 2 will be available on PC exclusively from the Blizzard Launcher, which likely means you'll be able to buy it using World of Warcraft Tokens.
Back in February, the rules were changed on WoW Tokens, which could only previously be redeemed using in-game gold for extra subscription time. Now they can be used in exchange for Blizzard Launcher (formerly the Battle.net app) credit.
According to Kotaku, the price of WoW Tokens has spiked since the reveal of Destiny 2 and the announcement that it would be available through Blizzard's store on PC. Currently, people are using any in-game gold they don't need to buy things like Hearthstone card packs and Overwatch loot boxes.
The Tokens reached as expensive as 140,000 gold on the in-game Auction House at one point, before falling back down to around 120,000 gold. To buy with real money, the Tokens cost $20.
If you're short on cash, but great at grinding WoW gold, it looks like you've got your own way of grabbing Destiny 2 when it comes out. It's currently due for a September 8 release on console, however the PC version may be coming later.

Wrestling Wrap Up: The Women's MITB Match is the Best Thing in WWE Right Now - IGN

Say "momentum" again! I dare you! I double dare you, mothereffer! [imagine Jules Winnfield with the suit and the gun and the terrified Frank Whaley and all that]
No, I'm not going to dive back into my dumb ol' momentum rant... but you see what I mean now, right? Nothing but momentum talk heading into both Extreme Rules and Money in the Bank. No one watching wresting in 2017 thinks momentum is a thing that's a thing. Even if Cole insists that "every match tonight, every moment, counts," none of them do and none of it does. It doesn't matter that Roman beat Seth in the main event. Or that Ziggler beat AJ on SmackDown. RAW and Smackdown, on the main event levels, have been empty calories for weeks now. And even though RAW's winding down because its PPV is this weekend, SmackDown still has a few more weeks of this malarky.
At least SmackDown's angle is all funneling toward someone getting that MITB briefcase. Which, although someone's not always holding it, is really the WWE's secondary title. This will be the first year in a while though that MITB is brand specific. Still, it's more exciting than finding out which dude gets to lose to Brock at Balls of Fire.
Basically, that entire storyline is the equivalent of a bunch of guys honking their car horns during morning rush hour because they're angry that they might be late for the job they hate. This is how you want to spend your energy? It's all this backwards race to see who'll lose to Brock. This, of course, all amid rumors that WWE is in fact spinning its wheels until SummerSlam.
Here's some good news though. After this week's big chaotic melee, the SmackDown ladies are getting their own MITB ladder match. Which A: is awesome because it's a first and because so far only RAW was getting all the women's "firsts" during its Charlotte/Sasha feud - The Cell match. The IronWoman bout. The Falls Count Anywhere match (which wasn't a first, but still...). Now SmackDown gets some. And Charlotte because she's on SmackDown, gets some more.
Oh, and B: SmackDown's been running this team warfare angle with the women for more than a month now. They've already had next-to-no stakes for weeks. It's just been tag matches and random match ups between stables that hold little weight. This ladder match actually helps mold this team warfare into something hefty and investable. It'll actually help one of these ladies rise up above the rest.
The SmackDown women's division is a bit of a double-edged sword because their use of all the women all the time creates too level a playing field. On the flip side, it's only a two hour show and it frequently features all its women. RAW has to banish Sasha to 205 Live just so she can get more air time (and hopefully draw Sasha stans like me to 205, which didn't work whoops).
Wow! First ever Money in the Bank Women's Ladder Match! Amazing how #SmackdownLive uses their ENTIRE women roster every Tuesday!

Microsoft has clarified how it will approach the power disparity between Xbox One and its upcoming Scorpio upgrade when it comes to frame rate and resolution.
As noted by GameSpot, Xbox corporate vice president Mike Ybarra sparked conversation by tweeting: "Developers are free to choose how they use the power of Project Scorpio for games. We have no requirements limiting framerate or fidelity."
This led to a question regarding parity of framerates between the same game playing on Xbox One and Scorpio, particularly in multiplayer (where differing framerates can make a definable alteration in quality of play). Ybarra made clear that, if they wanted, developers could allow for different framerates between consoles, even in multiplayer.
No, there isn't. This is up to the developer to choose, for their games, what they want to do. https://t.co/bFW7gcni7d

                                                The Surge is an action-RPG that features innovative combat mechanics and an original character progression system based on modular upgrades gained through tight, visceral combat. Set in a heavily dystopian future as Earth nears the end of its life, those who remain in the overpopulated cities must work to survive as social programs become saturated by an ageing population and increasing environmental diseases. As the intelligence of technology incrementally increased over the years, many jobs for the human race had been made redundant, forcing Earth's citizens to head out into the suburbs seeking labor, aided by exoskeletons to improve their efficiency. The world of The Surge offers a very grim vision of the future, where the evolution of our technology, our society and our relation with the environment led to a decadent state of the Human civilization.

Shadow of War expands on the Nemesis System with the introduction of Followers who bring about entirely new stories of loyalty, betrayal and revenge.

Zelda: Breath of the Wild - 46 Tiny Mind-Blowing Details - IGN Video


Cooking in Breath of the Wild is extensive, but there's no sort of in-game system to track recipes. You can find recipes throughout Hyrule on banners and learn them from various NPCs. 
Below are various cooked food recipes. Please refer to the rest of the guide for information on which items can add an effect. Some of these recipes don't include substitutions. 
These recipes are generally pretty flexible, so be sure to use ingredients with effects to get the most out of your meal. 
The following entree dishes don't use any meat and a majority can be altered to give extra effects. 
These are the dishes that'll make the best use of all the fish and crustaceans in Hyrule. If you're having trouble finding Hearty Salmon, try looking for it in the southern part of Herba Plunge just north of the Rito Stable in the Herba region. 
Make use of all the meat you've collected with these recipes. If you're having trouble finding Raw Whole Bird or Raw Bird Thighs, trying looking for the emu-like birds in the Eldin Canyon and around Death Mountain 
These recipes mix land and sea ingredients to create bountiful dishes. 


The Princess Zelda is one of the confirmed Characters in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Little is known about Zelda at this time, and more information will be added as it is revealed. 
Very little information is known about Zelda, other than that she is presumably the one that awakens Link from his slumber at the start of the game.
